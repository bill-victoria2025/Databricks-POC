I found my draw would go away if I removed power to the main cable from the under hood junction box to the under dash junction box. I removed all the fuses and relays in the junction box under the dash and still had a draw. I removed all the main power cables to the junction box and still had a draw. I traced the cable back and found the command start was tied into that wire. I found two relays that were part of the starter and one was powered up and engaged at all times. I unhooked power to the relay and the draw went away. It was 19mA. I reassembled all components and retested for a draw. It was back, 230mA. I removed the command start completely and all the related wiring harnesses. I returned it to stock. No damaged or shorted wires were found. During this I found the DVD player was wired into the command start wiring. I removed it as well. The draw a was gone. Again I reassembled and the draw came back.

It's still got the original factory drums, in excellent shape. I cut them, and they still drag mustily, in forward rotation. I kept releasing the adjustment back, with no avail. The parking brake cables are fine, and lose. Once you remove the torque from the wheel nuts, the problem is gone. After I kept releasing the adjustment, and still dragging, I took the wheel off, and the drum was very lose on the brake shoes. I used a WBR brake shoes from world pack, because the grab better than regular shoes. They look like a metallic compound in the shoes. The shoes are installed correct, the short one in the front, that is how they come out, and people on you Tube said. Is there a proportional valve in the back that could do this? I haven't tried to open the bleeder. The fact that the removal of the wheel, gives the slack back, makes me believe, that the torque of the wheel appears to cause it. Can't make the connection to this. It didn't have this problem before. Thanks for any help you can provide. Alfie.</td><td>Sounds like the brake drum is contacting something - most likely the outer edge of the brake shoes or the backing plate. Bolt the drums on with the lug nuts and turn the drums several times, then take them off and look for witness marks. It might help to put paint on the likely interference surfaces if the first try doesn't show you what's contacting. I don't like the idea of using brake shoes that \"grab better\" than OE, especially on rear brakes.

Direct battery voltage when button pushed (It would crank) all the other circuits at the relay check good.. This also sent battery voltage to the ecm start signal wire. Which is why the relay and ecm were replaced.I don't see the exhaust cam position sensor counting up with key on. Or any codes. If you have specific information about a Sonic with this symptom.

I got this cat here with a ABS/ Stability Ctl./ Traction control message. Also, the speedometer is intermittently inop, when speedo is inop, Transmission Failure message appears,( obviously), no speed signal= no Trans control, cool. This particular car has a Mercedes Benz tranny 722.635 which we have rebuilt many and we know the transmission is good, we even took the valve body out and replaced the solenoids and both turbine speed sensors.

P.S the part # for the sensor is LJA2226AA</td><td>If you get a C1095 and codes for the front wheel speed sensors from the ABS control module, then it is most likely a bad ABS module. BTW, its usually the harness not the sensor if it does come down to sensor issues. Jag was smart enough to make the harness relaceable.

While the trouble is occuring the door will not allow exterior entry as well, even with the exterior key in use on that door.The second problem is the alarm arming tone is also intermittant.As mentioned earlier the system fails the security system self test; 1) Arm system w/the key from either the drivers or pass door key 2) Lift all 4 locks within 10 sec. (The locks are not pulled down and the pump does not activate as our MOD information indicates it should.)And the second part of the test Quote; (cannot perform this one because we fail the first) 1)After the first test pulls all the locks down again and the pump runs, wait 15 seconds and pull all 4 locks up again in succession. ( wait 24 seconds after locking drivers door) It should now not be possible to unlock the doors, at the same time the pump should start back up and pull the lock knobs back. At the same time , the door lock is deactivated and no longer possible to open the door. 2) repeat proceedure using the passenger's door.With the limited information available I can only assume that the door latch or vacuum solinoid are faulty on the first complaint. The self test on the second part indicates that the controller is capable of holding the door locks down and making the door incapable of opening. Does the controller apply vacuum w/a single control solinoid or does it have multiple solinoids for the various doors inside the controller? If it has multiple lock control solinoids in the controller that is seems posible that the lock on the pass front door could be an intermittant non op due to vacuum holding on this door and be the fault of the controller.Tsb and Iatn archive searches found nothing on this trouble.Visual inspection of the latch and solinoid assembly show nothing (High tech modular assemblies! do they think this thing is going to the moon or what?)(Crack does more than kill)What do you think?

Each part can be tested for flow with a garden hose one component at a time. If there is low flow in one of three or more you know it will overheat. You will get the feel of how much flow to experience with the garden hose flowing. Be sure to reclaim any coolant before you start the process. BMW coolant is good to run after a thorough flush and chase with 100 PSI compressed air. The engine runs clockwise when facing the vibration dampner. Any pulley with the belt on the bottom or on the left will automatically turn CCW. The water pump belt is on the left and it will turn CCW. Good Luck, Gary\n",

The MAP voltage seems off to me, but the spec is that it drops 2 volts at 20\"hg, which it does.This feels totally like a breathing problem, but I am out of bullets on this one.

       "Hi Chris- Here's the information on lining up those balance shafts. By left shaft, I'm assuming you mean the shaft at the front of the car. When you line up the mark on the shaft pulley (at about 11 o'clock), don't worry about using the 6mm pin in the hole (the exhaust is usually in the way, anyways). When the mark is lined up, simply move the pulley slightly off the mark. If the balance weight is at the right spot, the shaft will try to move back to the index mark. If it tries to roll further away from the index, rotate the shaft one revolution, then repeat moving the shaft slightly off the mark; it will try to move back to the mark. The extra step in the timing marks is due to the gear ratio difference in the oil pump drive. The rear shaft is simply lined up with the mark (about 9 o'clock). Cams, crank are as in the manual. Also, don't forget to use www.hmaservice.comfor the factory manual information. Also, check to see the upper belt cover is updated; the new one will have a \"bump\" on the inside of the cover to help keep the belt from jumping time. You may also want to take a close look at the crank sensor and reluctor plate to see if there has been any contact. These have been a problem occasionally, with the CKP failing and the motor stops running. While the belt is off is the time to check it. Finally, check the TSB 03-20-002 for a crank bolt update. Some torque loss can allow the pulley, reluctor and sprocket to move around, wrecking the crank, reluctor and sprocket.\n",

       "Chris, Richard nailed it. Make sure to replace the balance shaft belt and auto tensioner also, verify that the wiring for the crank sensor is tucked out of the way of the T-Belt to prevent rub through, and don't over-tighten the balance shaft belt. The balance shaft belt should have approximately 10mm of \"slack\". If it is too tight it will cause it to \"walk\" wearing it out very quickly and possibly causing severe damage. After it is all reassembled you will need to turn the motor over 6 times by hand for all of the marks to line back up correctly and verify correct timing. Good luck, these aren't too bad once you've done a few.\n",

       "The smallest leak (in the heater core) will result in loss of system pressure. Perhaps it only leaks once it warms up. Suggest U Warm car up with radiator cap off and THEN pressure test it. Unpressurized coolant can boil, and the cooling system no longer works as designed. Result: Overheating. Once it's boiling, big pockets of water vapor DISPLACE coolant in the heater core, so you lose heat. It also forces coolant out into the overflow, and once THAT overflows, onto the ground.

       "Because the heater core circuit is vital to the proper flow of coolant in the system. Some vehicles do not have an issue with this, as the core circuit is an 'adjunct' to the system, and is not part of the total flow.To determine a core that is restricted is rather easy. Just measure the temp difference between the two hoses. There should be very little difference, just a few degrees. This signifies that all the tubes are open in the core. As more tubes become restricted, the flow is lessened, resulting in a reduced surface area for heat transfer, and the remaining tubes get too much transfer. The result is a cold core, because it has less internal volume.Example: original core has 200 tubes, and this is the designed surface area for maximum airflow, with good heat transfer. Half the tubes are plugged, resulting in much more heat loss for the open tubes, thus one hose colder than the other.

       "Delivery system: Fuel Injection Affected component: Engine Conditions: Smokes Badly</td><td>This Saab was driving down the road when it started smoking profusely. Was so bad customer had the car towed in. We confirmed the smoke was engine oil by it's color and smell. When the car is started cold there is no smoke until it starts to warm up. If you then rev the engine a couple times it will put out smoke and continue to smoke as long as you let it idle. And it's a lot. At a steady 1500 rpm I thought the fire dept might be stopping by as you could hardly see my building. Removed spark plugs which all were clean. Looked at pistons with bore scope and they are all clean and evenly lightly coated with brown carbon. Removed exhaust pipe at turbo and hoses at inner cooler. All is dry there, ruling out a turbo failure. We ran the car for about a half hour hoping oil fouling would show up but when we pulled the plugs all still looks clean in spite of the smoking. Took off the valve cover and looked at the valve seals which looked intact. Checked crank case pressure which is acceptable and the PCV is sucking what feels to be about the right amount of air volume. There is no oil leaking down the hose which goes back to the air boot at the turbo inlet. Oil level is correct and clean by the way. So we decided to take off the head and inspect the valve guides closer as something obviously broke and changed from all ok to smoking in a moments time. While taking off the head we noticed oil in the intake manifold, heavier on #3 runner where the PCV sucks it's vacuum from directly above it. Which brings us back to the breather but what? There is a baffle in the valve cover which is intact and appears to be there to stop oil from going into the inlet of the pcv fitting. With the Fitting out of the valve cover and the engine running it isn't spitting any oil out. Just a little blow by but not excessive. Well by the time we saw the intake the head was almost off so we finished removing it and found everything to be pretty nice, including newer valve stem seals. The head looks like it has been off within the last few years even though our cust has only had this car six months. I wish now we had run the car much longer with the PCV out of the VC to see if the smoking was less but hindsight is 20-20. We are replacing the VS seals and putting the head back on now, convinced the problem lies elsewhere, but where?Does this scenario ring a bell with any of you Saab guys?We are totally baffled at this point.Thanks</td><td>check for a restriction at the air inlet to the filter housing. this can cause a vacuum to be drawn in the air intake boot and may suck oil in through the breather Try running it with the air filter housing open and see if it still smokes.\n",

       "It's almost always the turbo. It can leak oil into the intake, or into the exhaust. Just because you don't see oil on the exhaust side, doesn't mean the oil isn't leaking into the intake.

Just because the headgaskets where changed doesn't mean that there isn't a problem with either the cylinder head itself or the engine block. The machine shope that milled the deck should have partical inspected the heads for cracks. These cracks can be invisible to the naked eye, but will cause the same problem as a blown head gasket. The engine block could also have a crack in it, this would not show up under compression test or cylinger leakage. One other things that I would consider would be a bad intake mainfold gasket.

         "I have this Lexus that came in with a blown timing belt and an overheat.The customer asked on the phone if we did that kind of work and although I try to stay away from full replacement we do head work all the time.Upon inspection the overheat was bad enough to crack the radiator.Talked the owner into a low mile (80000) motor.Normally would not do the job but she reminded me of her large towing expense and I did tell her on the phone we did \"engine\" work.We installed a new water pump/timing belt to be safe.Upon start up it had what sounded like a stuck lifter.The salvage yard requested that we drive it and see if it came out of it.After a week the noise is still there.Had the tech change the oil again with a Toyota filter and check valve clearance(these are not hydraulic lifters but a shimmed tappet.The noise seems be coming from the front of the right head though you hear it through the wheel well.Shorting out cylinders makes no change.Also checked for bent rods.I understand they had some wrist pin issues with this engine but it sounds too light in my opinion.Tried top engine cleaner and a borocope down the plug hole and came up empty. The salvage yard claims it was quiet when it left and would like a diagnosis before they decide what they want us to do.I will try to post an audio/video tomorrow but just looking for any common problems for now.Thanks in advance.",
         "sound like a bad lifter.\n\nChris, they don't have lifters. You could run it with the rocker cover off and see for anything obvious. Could it be a vvti problem? If this has it? Did the motor come with an intake? Could something be dropped down the intake port?\n\nI would check the cam shaft scissor gear for alignment, you should use a bolt to hold the alignment.Good luck Shawn\n\nHad a tech let one of these engines eat something ( don't know what ) but what ever it was knocked 1 valve keeper out of 2 different valve. believe it or not it didn't drop a valve. It was on the right side also. Good luck. Mark\n\nYou have t check the valve clearance cold. And did your tech find any shims not to spec? These things do make noise when the gap is to large and a proper shim may be all you need.\n\nI agree with Wayne from Florida. These are typically good motors and not an issue with a used one. However, it is not impossible that someone had messed with the engine prior to you receiving it. A simple test you can do to check if it is in the valves is to temporarily change the viscosity of the oil. This may change the noise and may help you get closer to finding the cause.\n\nThose cam gears have to be preloaded and a bolt placed into the gear to lock in place before installed. Once installed you can remove the bolt and it will be ok otherwise you get a noise. It could be that. Might be time to pull the pan and check the inside for bearing material. I had a Tundra that made a noise that sounded upper end and it had bearing material in the bottom of the pan when I pulled it. Toyota told me it's not uncommon to think it's coming from the upper end when it's bottom end one an all aluminum Toyota engine as the sound resonates. Just thinking top of my head here former Toyota dealer tech.\n\nTry to pinpoint which bank is the noise source. If it sound like a metallic ticking noise with the rhythm of a valve opening than you have to pull the cylinder head and reseat ( lap) the valves. Remove the camshaft and lifters and open and close the valves. See if the noise of closing the valve manually is the same. Other option is to red line the engine few times for several seconds. If something was trapped into the piston head may need to be seated. It is an easy friendly engine to work on. Unfortunately seems like you not getting paid for this. Good luck!",

I recommend you quit bankrupting yourself trying to be all things to all people.Many are learning a hard reality to only stick to one or maybe two brands these days, and even then limiting what models. We are in an age of specialization.Technology is moving so rapidly that even new models are having running production upgrades on a frequent basis.In 20 more years there will be practically nobody qualified to work on vehicles. Teams of engineers build these things but no one is educating the techs who are working on them. Many of the systems are not designed to be worked on. Vehicles are going just as any other electronics device, they are becoming an expendable commodity.Average laptop 3K... Average car 30K... life expectancy for each 3-5 years. Some, may be more, but many may be less.Sorry for the gray clouds, but quit beating your self up. I will not work on anything newer than a 2015.

         "If left parked this vehicle would have a dead battery within three days. This has been happening since the vehicle was new. It was at the dealership several times without being resolved. It has been at independent shops without being resolved. It has an aftermarket remote start as well as an aftermarket ceiling mounted DVD player w/ dome lights. After hooking up my equipment I started with the basics of pulling fuses. I found my draw would go away if I removed power to the main cable from the under hood junction box to the under dash junction box. I removed all the fuses and relays in the junction box under the dash and still had a draw. I removed all the main power cables to the junction box and still had a draw. I traced the cable back and found the command start was tied into that wire. I found two relays that were part of the starter and one was powered up and engaged at all times. I unhooked power to the relay and the draw went away. It was 19mA. I reassembled all components and retested for a draw. It was back, 230mA. I removed the command start completely and all the related wiring harnesses. I returned it to stock. No damaged or shorted wires were found. During this I found the DVD player was wired into the command start wiring. I removed it as well. The draw a was gone. Again I reassembled and the draw came back. Now I had the draw even when I unhooked the cable at the under hood junction box. I disassembled and broke down the junction box. I found I had a draw for the front blower motor and rear blower motor controller. When I unhooked the motor and controller my draw went away. I removed the control wire from the front blower motor and plugged it back in. The draw was gone for about 10 seconds and returned. I unhooked the blower motor and the draw was gone. The same thing in the rear. I left them unhooked and the draw came back. Plugging them back in didn't change the draw. I now had my draw from the short bar to the four fuses that are after it. The Radio 1, CRT, ECU B, and Dome. If I unplugged all the fuses my draw was gone, but if I plugged any one fuse in the draw came back. I decided since the draw was moving I may have a grounding issue. Prior to this I unplugged the NAV (radio) unit and the dome lights, etc. I still had a draw if I plugged one of the fuses in. I also monitored it over night to make sure I wasn't just not waiting long enough. We have had the vehicle in the shop for over a week now. I removed all the grounds and cleaned, dielectric greased and tightened them. There are a lot of grounds. I have this truck completely apart. After all this I still have a 230mA draw.",
         "I have seen this much draw on Cadillacs of years past and was considered normal?? Could this be \"normal draw? Anyone have a spec or vehicle to compare to?\n\nMax current draw any car should be no higher than about 100ma. Ck your basics, charging system, glove box light ect., than see if 1 of your computers is always on, or the alarm system\n\nhave seen the radio unit it self be a low < 300 ma draw\n\nShould have no more then 50ma draw, this is after disconnecting the neg battery terminal, connecting the amp meter and allowing it 20minutes. You can use a jumper wire between the neg post and batt terminal for a few minutes to be sure all the ecu's are in sleep mode.\n\nHi Graham, Do all the accessories work properly.? I had a Sequoia that had a draw, something in the rear gate{either the window or wiper} was inoperative but was keeping the BCM powered up because it was not parked properly. Check that all you factory stuff works properly.\n\nOn this late of a model, there is very little draw allowable, usually less than 20mA after all modules shutdown. The 50mA figure is old school spec, and does not apply here. Sounds as though you have a module not shutting down.\n\nLook up the voltage drop across fuse chart. If you don't have it I can email you it. Then use your voltage meter to single out exactly which fuse has the current draw. Seems like you keep waking something up while testing. I have seen bluetooth modules wake up when getting a signal from a phone.If you never have tried it, it is the best way to locate a draw on vehicles without disturbing the modules by circuit interruption.

         "Hi. This duramax had a tuner (bullydog) and is overfueling off idle, knocking at idle sometimes and misses on number 7 at idle.. I recently repaired two injector connectors that were a little burnt on cyl 2 and 6. now it runs better at idle. Cylinder #1 has a fuel knock that dissappears when it is disabled. A new injector did not solve that problem.. the sound actually is coming from the other side of the motor (weird). off idle the injection sounds like the pressure is spiked and it dumps out black smoke. If I disable cyl #5 the smoke disappears. An injector installed in that cyl 5 did not solve that problem. I feel there is a FICM problem but can't find info on testing output and control to injectors. Need some guidance. Anybody had a burned out FICM?",
         "Maybe the tuning in the car makes these problem happens, I think it is better to remove the tuning and test the car again.\n\nHi Tim.Your balance rates indicate Cylinder 7 is running lean and tryng to correct it.The connectors for 2 and 7 are a known problem depending on which 6.6.VIN 1 or 2.There is a revised connector and bracket kit.TSB 05-06-04-047c.This will normally set codes.When this occurrs it will run bad and fuel knock.Eliminate the aftermarket module first.Sometimes they will cause engine damage and or communications problems.I have seen a lot of burned up pistons from them.That is why it will void the engine warranty.Check #5 injector seals and sleeve for leaks.Good luck.\n\nDisconnect the tuner and make sure it's not a software issue in the tuner. Have had a few that were throwing false codes and running bad because of the tuner glitching\n\nGet rid of the chip first off, go from there. The makers of these things don't care how it affects the vehicle, as long as they have your money. I also don't believe there is enough testing done.\n\nHere is a link to a post in the forum section Tim. If it does not work just search [white smoke diagnostics] in the theory section. I use this method to locate the bad injectors, the one coment on the end is about min ms on time at idle. This does work, before it seemed unless i replaced all injectors we were sort of were just chasing our tail around. Give it a read. http://members.ia...=4&f=forum12&m=64765\n\nI don't know a lot about diesels because I always hated working on them. But I do know that the Duramax's had big problems with cracked injectors. May need to replace all of them.\n\nI hate to ask a stupid question but have you verified fuel quality? Bio diesel or gas will cause injector imbalances & knocking. Also for the smoking, make sure the MAF sensor is very clean and it doesn't have a K&N type air filter as it throws MAF sensor readings way off. and positive seven is as high as I think the FICM will bump the injector, so that one either isn't flowing or it's using that cylinder to try to balance out an adjacent firing cylinder.\n\nThe injector connector kit is for the vin 2 LLY engine and will shut down 4 injectors at a time when it trips fault. A cracked injector will smoke white at idle as it leaks during all strokes and blows raw fuel out exhaust. Your black smoke is either from combustion over fueling due to a skewed sensor of a lack of air from filter or turbo pressure.",

The radiator fan works as well as the speedo. The AC comp does engage. They say there should be an upshift light, but I certainly don't see one. The component that does not seem to work is the motorized seatbelt system. I found the larger of the 3 connectors disconnected and the belts in the B pillar position. The cusotmer said they bound up and I suspect that someone disconnected them in the rear position. I rehooked them up and the belt \"wants\" to work but is bound up. I hear the seatbelt module click sometimes when i am accelerating on the rack. I am at a bit of a loss here as to if I should pursue the seatbelt module or if i am missing something. And what is with this upshift light that is supposed to be there but does not seem to be. ThanksRon",
         "Ronald, neither seal belt or shift light system will effect the map sensor. If you have scan data and a vacuum pump you can test the performance of the map sensor. Also if you look where the map sensor vacuum line hooks up at the t-body you will see that the vacuum port is part of a housing that attaches to the t-body with some fasteners. You may have to take the t-body off the intake but remove the fasteners and take the housing off. The gasket between the housing and the t-body fails and causes a vacuum leak and an incorrect map output.....Rosco\n\nHi Ronald, Code 26 will set if the upshift light is burnt out. It is an amber bulb located in the lower right of the instrument cluster. I remember this because I've worked on a Saturn where the PCM was replaced for a Code 26 (QDM fault) and the MIL still came back. It was the upshift bulb all along.\n\nDitto on the upshift lamp bulb, it and the EGR & EVAP solenoids are ground controlled through the ECM. The quad driver codes will set if the circuits open/short or resistance gets too high. The ECM will shut down control of the circuit for internal damage protection. The upshift lamp must be functioning. The EGR & EVP solenoids are very common issues on these cars after 90,000 miles or so. Replace them if the upshift lamp bulb does not completely cure the problem. HTH! Matt\n\nchances are that upshift light is your culprit. quad driver turns it on, if the bulb is burned out the cel will come on. i am assuming this car has a manual trans.",

It will release the brakes also, if we loosen the two nuts that hold the master cylinder to the hydro boost (about 1-2 turns on the nuts) Later discovered that slight tap on the brake pedal releases the pressure in the brake system and wheels will go free again. Symptom appeared after leaky master cylinder replacement. Since than another MC was tried, new calipers and flexible brake hoses all around, used hydro-boost. At that point we inherited the truck from the first shop. Flushed the PS fluid, tried third and fourth master cylinder, one new one used, brakes still lock-up after short drive and hard push on the brake pedal.

         "Have you pulled up on the brake peddle to see if they release?\n\nIt does sound like the rod is too long, when you crack open the bolts between mc and booster, fluid returns properly. Try putting washers between mc and booster temporarily, if it doesn't lock up, there is a problem with the pushrod, maybe not seating correctly.\n\nMy guess would be the power steering pump is bad.\n\nobviously something is causing the brake booster push rod to push forward on the master cylinder. You can remove the master cylinder and see if the push rod moves when you start the truck. Binding brake pedal?, Binding brake switch? Incorrectly adjusted brake switch? Bad used brake booster or wrong one?\n\nA defective or incorrect hydo-boost or incorrect push rod length will cause the pedal lock up. If brake pedal is not binding on its pivot I would replace the h-b with a new GM hydro-boost or with one that included the push rod as per the application.\n\nThe hydro-booster is not returning to a full rest position or there is some mechanical interference which prevents full release.\n\nWeng, If problem started after master cyl replacement and pressure releases with bolts loosend at hydroboost,sounds like one of those would be the problem.If pressure releases with a tap on the brake pedal possibly something binding not allowing full return?Would be nice to have old parts to compare.If problem started with master would look closely at that.\n\nYes pull up the pedal when locked but make sure if it goes up some the relay rod to the booster follows. Make sure nothing is blocking the pedal return like a trailer brake system, line lock, jerk wiring or repair job or whatever. Is it possible the HB unit is staying applied because it can't bleed off the apply pressure due to a restricted hose or something?\n\nI think that you will find that the brake pedal pivot is binding/sticking, if you are able to make the brakes release with a pull up of the pedal after your moderate to hard stop.Good Luck\n\nCheck for binding in the brake pedal if you do not find any replace the booster with a new or rebuilt one.\n\nAfter realizing the brakes released when you unbolted the master cylinder from the booster, why did you try 2 more master cylinders?

Best Regards Bill\n\nHi Jason, The throttle body should have a readaption done to it after cleaning. Usually you get a code for \"Idle Adaption Exceeds Limits\" when that is the problem. If it comes back, suspect a bad ignition switch. Wiggle the switch when it is dying to see if that keeps it running. bob Paul's Motor Car Service\n\nPlease cheack all electrical connectors,there can be oxide formation which restrict the current flow,clean the ECM connector with contactspray. Cheak all vaccume hoses realting to engine.\n\nJason check the crank and cam sensors. Also check the wiring at the crank sensor, I've had this symptom and there was corrosion in the plug-in for the crank sensor. Good luck",

I always crank the engine for compression stroke TDC before installing distributer, or a check for proper rotor location. If timing was off, you would not have compression.What you say doesn't add up. The thing is, someone reading this isn't going to learn from what you listed, because until you moved distributer everything else was right. So what was done, you don't say you did a chain. So why was distributer out? Your facts aren't right. If you or customer did chainOK, but the distributer was never indexed to it. That is why it didn't start, not that the 180 dots.\n\nI agree with Harold.....there is another (recent) post where the guy (tried) to pass off the SAME stuff on us....Dan H.\n\nIt (also) was a Jeep 4.0...but a '99....and it was Jon from Ill. who said the crank and cam was 180* out....yeah,RIGHT.......Dan H.\n\nFirst of all,150 lb,s across the board tells you the engine is mechanicly good.Cam timing \"WAS\"correct,remember the drive ratio is two to one.When the crank is on tdc compression stroke,the two gears are dot to dot,but as the crank makes one more round to tdc again,it is now at top of exhaust and the cam has only turned half a revolution,which is where you found it. One more turn of the crank brings the two dots back together.Remember it takes two complete revolutions of the crank to complete on full cycle. I dont know what your problem was without seeing more,but it wasn,t cam timing if the crank dot was at 12 oclock and the cam was also at 12 oclock.Every other revolution will repeat this!! This is four stroke principle 101\n\nHi Chris.. all cams turn at 1/2 crank speed, so every other revolution the cam gear will appear 180 degrees out.. Turn the crank 1 full turn & check your marks again.. When you are trying to index the dist. wad up a paper towel in the # 1 plug hole & Bump the starter, when the paper blows out then turn the crank the rest of the way to TDC by hand & Dist. is ready to be installed.. align the rotor button to where it should be & make sure the fireing pickup parts are aligned & Should be close enough to fire right up.. Hope this Helps for Next time ;>? K.P.\n\nHi Chris.. clicked \" Refresh \" & then saw Keith's Message.. I have seen some pontiac V-8's that have had the marks 180 out & been ON the compression stroke.. So I Learned a Long time ago Not to trust the cam gear marks for dist placement... SHTH ;>? K.P.\n\nThe only question that remains is whether the spark is strong enough.Good luck.\n\nHi Chris, When @ tdc you should have dot to dot. But to verify bring crank to tdc. Cam dot will be in time(dot to dot)and distributor rotor at #1 on cap. OR crank at tdc and cam 180 out(like you wrote) AND distributor rotor 180 out. I believe it is in time.

The parking brake cables are fine, and lose. Once you remove the torque from the wheel nuts, the problem is gone. After I kept releasing the adjustment, and still dragging, I took the wheel off, and the drum was very lose on the brake shoes.

The shoes are installed correct, the short one in the front, that is how they come out, and people on you Tube said. Is there a proportional valve in the back that could do this? I haven't tried to open the bleeder. The fact that the removal of the wheel, gives the slack back, makes me believe, that the torque of the wheel appears to cause it. Can't make the connection to this. It didn't have this problem before. Thanks for any help you can provide. Alfie.",
         "Sounds like the brake drum is contacting something - most likely the outer edge of the brake shoes or the backing plate. Bolt the drums on with the lug nuts and turn the drums several times, then take them off and look for witness marks. It might help to put paint on the likely interference surfaces if the first try doesn't show you what's contacting. I don't like the idea of using brake shoes that \"grab better\" than OE, especially on rear brakes. A lot of aftermarket brake shoe friction compounds caused performance problems on both front and rear wheel GM vehicles back then - too \"grabby\". Good luck - hope this helps.\n\nI agree with Phil..sounds like the shoes are too wide and when the lug nuts torgue down, it causes them to drag on the drum face OR forces them into the backing plate..is the backing plate and backing plate contact area in the drum nice and clean?....I too dont like the \"grabby\" shoes on these old beasts.\n\nI also agree. There has to be something getting jammed when you tighten the wheel nuts and the most likely candidate is the shoes are probably too wide. This is another thing where you may have too much of a good thing and that is the grabby shoes. The ABS may help make them a little more acceptable, but why introduce addl problems to a system that did the job.\n\n20 year old drums are probably not holding the torque,flexing in at the center.\n\nMatch up the old brake shoes with the new ones, I'm sure you'll find your problem\n\nAlmost sounds like the shoes are too wide and catch on the edge of the shoe when you tighten it down. Did you check for that? I don't think your problem is from the shoes being adjusted too tightly. I think you should look for something else to do with the brakes dragging, such as what I mentioned above.\n\nI had that same problem on a cadillac years ago it was the brake shoes, I would try a different set of shoes.\n\nI had that same problem on a cadillac years ago it was the brake shoes, I would try a different set of shoes.\n\ni think brake shoes are to wide good luck\n\nWould agree that most likely the brake shoes are incorrect BUT you ought to be able to look at the inside of the drum and/or the edge of the shoes and see where it's scraping if it's the shoe width that's the problem. The only other issue may be corrosion built up on the hub that's causing the drum to warp when it's tightened down. Maybe a light coat of black spray-can paint on the inside of the drum could help ID the contact point (wipe back off with brake cleaner when you're done). HTH\n\nHii Alfiero Sounds like the new shoes are to wide check the width of the old ones compared to the new ones been there done this before good luck\n\nI'd try new shoes. We don't use WBR shoes anymore because of fitment issues like this, and because of excessive dusting.\n\nShoes probably too wide. Compare them to the original ones.\n\nSounds like the edge of shoes need to be beveled I do it to all of my shoes just so I don't gotta go back I even bevel the front and rear so it has a smoother transition while braking\n\nCould the brake shoes be a tad to wide. measure the old ones for width. Seems everything else has been looked at. Maybe re install the one side of old set of shoes adjust like new and torque the wheel. Does the same thing happen? if not then the new shoes have a problem.Hope this helps\n\nHi, would have to agree with everyone else that the shoes are too wide, maybe not the linings but the webbing it self. Good luck, Andy\n\nAs the others say too wide brake shoes. But Phil could be right if the edges are pulling up. Could there just be so much rust on the drum and backing plate? Are the axle flanges or backing plates bent?\n\nare the shoes too wide ? or produced wrong. compare to old shoes for size and be sure wheel cylinders are correct size.\n\nSounds like you have the wrong shoes- they are too wide. As you tighten down the wheel the drum presses on the edge of the shoes and will lock it up. Measure the width of the old shoes and compare.\n\nTry a different set of shoes\n\nShim the drums [use some washers] on each stud and tighten drums down and see if it helps. At least you would know if the shoes are contacting the backing plates. DO NOT LEAVE THE WASHERS ON THE STUDS, PERMANENTLY.\n\nLook in the drum, if you see a shoulder where the drum isn't machined back to the drum face its machined wrong! That shoulder needs cut out so the entire area is flat, I've seen this several times. The only other things it can be is either wrong ( too wide) or poorly manufactured shoes!\n\nFirst make sure your lathe cut to the bottom of the drum. Then install new rivited name brand shoes.Make sure you can slap shoes side to side to center.Then grind a small amount of lining off outside edge of shoes.If vechicle does not stop good, most stopping power is on the front.hope this helps\n\nAs stated above, need to find out where/how they are dragging. If only one side, I was thinking maybe cracked drum. If both and didn't do it before, likely bad tolerance on parts.\n\nEither the shoes are wrong width or thickness. The park brake cable could be hanging up also. Are the shoes against the pivot pin at top? If they are not the cable or cables are stuck.\n\ndouble check the width of the new brake shoes,they might be slightly wider then the old ones and causing the shoes to drag on the drums when the wheels are tightened up\n\nEverybody is assuming original wheels; If they are aftermarket, it may be necessary to use a 1/8 or even 1/4 spacer between hub and rim; I've even found this on OEM wheels from a different year than the vehicle. At least it's a cheap experiment, to help narrow down the problem.\n\nOn rare occasions I have incurred this on multiple types of vehicles. Every time the drum was dragging on the edge of the brake shoe. Another set of shoes fixed them all.\n\ntry putting the drum on different studs and see if it helps. axle flange or drum center maybe off.\n\nAlfiero, Agree sounds like I would match old shoes w new.\n\nTry putting new brake hardware; springs, pins and all the other parts that come in a kit.\n\nGlad it ended well. Hint: check your spelling so that no one is offended.\n\nMakes me wonder if there is a left and right with those shoes.

         "Seems like a major issue with these. There is a cheesy lock/unlock sequence supposed to help, but who knows...http://www.lemonl...ic-starting-problem/\n\nI am assuming you are checking voltage at the relay? Check voltage coming out of PCM on pin 17 in x1 connector, if you have 12 volts there and not at pin 85 of the relay you have a bag fuse box. If you don't have voltage at pin 17, load test powers and grounds at PCM.\n\nHi Kenny,Looking at a schematic, I would want to know if the PCM could produce good voltage at pin 17 connector X1 (yell wire), if the PCM can produce good voltage there unhooked, I would then measure the voltage at PCM, the relay and the starter with everything connected. It is possible there is a poor connection or voltage drop present.If the PCM is not able to produce the correct voltage, I would be checking the powers and grounds in to it. Good luck with it.Sam\n\nkenny, push putton! i would start there put it back to stock.\n\nI had one of these. Put a volt meter on the battery and watch it whilst you're trying to crank it over. The one I worked on the battery voltage would drop down to 8v at times then I'd look and it would be 12v. I tested it with a Midtronics and it passed. So I load tested a few times and the voltage would drop to 10v then 9v then I'd let the battery sit for a minute and the voltage would go back to 12v. I've been at this since 1972 and I've never had a battery do this. ~Cheers~\n\nvoltage drop as the last tech mentioned what is battery doing ,what is voltage at starter\n\nVoltage drop test the power and ground circuits at the ECM connectors and the relay.A bad connection at the fuse block connector or ECM can cause this.The BCM is the ignition mode master and it sends a serial data message to the ECM for crank request so monitor the data as well.\n\nhas to be a voltage drop, i agree with what out5hers have said\n\nOhms law still applies to a Sonic or any other car.I have 30 years experience and told you to monitor BCM ignition mode data while you are cranking to see if the crank request stays on.I will not try to help you again.I am a GM Master Tech and have worked on these Daewoo cars.\n\nI understand the desire for vehicle specific help, but many times that is not available.Is there any chance of a scope capture/file? If you are not sure how to upload a file and link it I could run you through the process.I would still like to see out of the ecm, at the fuse box and at the starter. The newer vehicle fuse boxes are of a low quality and fail often.If all three of these voltages are very close, most likely there is a input problem to the ecm. Seems unlikely that a new ecm would be defective, but that is also a possibility.Good luck, Sam\n\nKenny,Here is a link to a Sonic forum with a no crank concern.

         "Hello fellow Jaguar techs.! I got this cat here with a ABS/ Stability Ctl./ Traction control message. Also, the speedometer is intermittently inop, when speedo is inop, Transmission Failure message appears,( obviously), no speed signal= no Trans control, cool. This particular car has a Mercedes Benz tranny 722.635 which we have rebuilt many and we know the transmission is good, we even took the valve body out and replaced the solenoids and both turbine speed sensors. Now, I got 2 questions for you guys: does the speedo on this Jag take speed info from the ABS module like the Benz does? if so, I know what to look for next. Does anyone know FOR SURE? not guessing, Alldata, Mitchell 5, and Autodata have very poor diagrams on this system and I hate to pay $200 to use manufacturers website. Second question: The wheel speed sensors on this car are OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE, has anyone found a cheap replacement for them (like Ford, MBZ, or any other sensor that might work? I got to get the ABS module working before I can get CAN readings. I'm not all for hacking cars but Im trying to do a little more affordable troubleshooting. Thanks. P.S the part # for the sensor is LJA2226AA",
         "If you get a C1095 and codes for the front wheel speed sensors from the ABS control module, then it is most likely a bad ABS module. BTW, its usually the harness not the sensor if it does come down to sensor issues. Jag was smart enough to make the harness relaceable. I do believe the primary speed data is sent accross the CAN network from the ABS module. However, if the data is missing it will calculate from other sources.\n\nDitto what Brian said. I've had a lot of Jags with bad harnesses going to the wheel speed sensors.\n\nThese vehicles do get their speed information from abs module. Wheel speed sensors rarely fail,the harnesses are the bits that fail. Abs faults also can be from pump motor failure due to dry soldered joints at pump wiring on circuit board in module.Easy fix with 1\" hole saw at back of pump terminals ,resolder and plug hole with a grommet.$$$$ saved. You must hook up a scan tool that can interface with these vehicles otherwise you are flying blind.Launch are not good with these sort of situations.\n\ncan U communicate w/abs_tcs?? what codes do U have??\n\nI can let you know a far more convenient place to get the circuit diagrams if you tell me your email addy.\n\nwhat codes did you retreive from abs computer and what diagnostic computer are you using.paul\n\nOscar,Check torque of rear axle nuts.I have had 2 cars with a loose nut & then the abs ring spins freely at times.John\n\nIt gets the speed signal from the abs. Most of the time the fly lead going to the sensor goes bad and it is not that much. very easy to test just disconnect it at the sensor and then in the engine compartment and then ohm out the wires.\n\nOscar, On the questionable ABS module, I have had a bad one or few and BBA Reman fixes them for less than $200. I was told that if a unit that came from another car was put on it had to be programmed so that is a benefit of having the original unit repaired. I got the idea that this is a common problem. The unit can be removed without opening brake fluid lines also. Hope this helps some.\n\nHi Oscar, harness link leads were problematic, wish u well, Rob",

While the trouble is occuring the door will not allow exterior entry as well, even with the exterior key in use on that door.The second problem is the alarm arming tone is also intermittant.As mentioned earlier the system fails the security system self test; 1) Arm system w/the key from either the drivers or pass door key 2) Lift all 4 locks within 10 sec. (The locks are not pulled down and the pump does not activate as our MOD information indicates it should.)And the second part of the test Quote; (cannot perform this one because we fail the first) 1)After the first test pulls all the locks down again and the pump runs, wait 15 seconds and pull all 4 locks up again in succession. ( wait 24 seconds after locking drivers door) It should now not be possible to unlock the doors, at the same time the pump should start back up and pull the lock knobs back. At the same time , the door lock is deactivated and no longer possible to open the door. 2) repeat proceedure using the passenger's door.With the limited information available I can only assume that the door latch or vacuum solinoid are faulty on the first complaint. The self test on the second part indicates that the controller is capable of holding the door locks down and making the door incapable of opening. Does the controller apply vacuum w/a single control solinoid or does it have multiple solinoids for the various doors inside the controller? If it has multiple lock control solinoids in the controller that is seems posible that the lock on the pass front door could be an intermittant non op due to vacuum holding on this door and be the fault of the controller.Tsb and Iatn archive searches found nothing on this trouble.Visual inspection of the latch and solinoid assembly show nothing (High tech modular assemblies! do they think this thing is going to the moon or what?)(Crack does more than kill)What do you think?

         "Hello I have this jeep that is running hot, the jeep came in skipping so we checked it out and it had a blowed headgasket.We installed a jasper reman engine with the install kit and we put a new radiator in it. it continues to run hot we have three different temp gauges the dash gauge the scanner and a manual temp gauge. Ive replaced the waterpump and thermostat again just to make sure the waterpump was right it has r stamped on the impeller and the water pump is turning counter clockwise. I took the heater hose off the thermostat housing and started the jeep up and no water will come out the hose unless I give it 1500 or so rpm. I called jasper and told them everything we have tried,so they sent another engine, we installed it still running 230- 240 going down the road. the electric fan is working and the clutch fan is good both fans are pulling air very good and the a/c condenser is clean.it has a winch bumper on it so we took it off and put a piece of tin in the place were the bumper went to make sure air was going threw the radiator.i looked at the jasper engine that we pulled out thinking headgasket installed wrong but it wasn't. the only thing I seen was the engine had .075 piston stamped on top. im going to try this morning bypassing the heater core because I read on another iatn post the heater core hoses can get crossed and make it run hot, not sure about that but at this point anything is possible.i was wondering it seems like the heater hose should be pumping water at idle to because if not the heater would blow cold at idle. And can these engines be bored .075 and not build heat the cooling system cant get rid of.I took the center out of the thermostat and just put the outside ring of the thermostat back in and ran it it cooled down to about 224 degrees and ive tried 180 and 195 degree thermostats no difference. thanks for any help don't no what to do next",

It is possible to have the belt on the wp backwards and still achieve belt tension.\n\nI called Mr. MoPar parts monkey in the adjacent town and he said there are two different pumps shown for a '96 Jeep 4.0L(one CCW and one CW)...I'd bet you have the wrong one on your's... after that conversation....but remember ...he's a parts monkey....Dan H....one mo time...\n\nI'm on board with wrong water pump, fought this problem a few times myself, at this point I would try the other possibility, what do you have to lose. Good luck.\n\nCCW is correct rotation.I usually fill these with Temp sender out until they flow out the hole & then put sender back.This seems to help eliminate air pockets.Had one with a rag caught in the hose from expansion tank that gave the same problem.\n\nThere has to be something plugged up if the belt routing and water pump are correct! I would first order both water pumps and compare them to insure the correct one is used in this application. At that point blow air through each of the hoses to make sure they're open. If this has a mechanical fan reve the engine while standing in front and verify the air is being pulled through the radiator and not pushed backwards through it because of belt routing or wrong fan blade ( I've seen it!). Let us know what you find, good luck\n\n98% chance wrong water pump... 2% chance the lower hose is full of stop-leak, a rag, or a shipping plug. Jeep 4.0's usually insist on a vacuum coolant fill. Blocking off the heater hoses will guarantee an overheat; there MUST be circulation through that circuit for the thermostat to open, and remaining air to purge. Wrong water pump from a previous repair might be the root cause of overheat/head gasket failure.I'm currently driving an '89 with 290,xxx miles on it as my daily beater, so I've had some practice.\n\nTry another water pump. Make sure you have the correct belt routing. Coolant should flow from heater hoses even at a dead idle.\n\nI am thinking you have a possible have a water pump issue or a heater core issue. I would check your new pump against the original to see if it has the proper impeller . Also bypass the heater core or try flushing it with a garden hose and see what kind of flow you have\n\nHad an issue similar to yours. Check the water pump impeller. The one I changed impeller was cracked in half. I just slapped in a new one and yes it was the wrong water pump.good luck\n\nAre you sure the pistons are marked .075, and not 0.75, which would be the metric equivalent of .030\".\n\nTry another water pump\n\nTry matching the blades of the new pump against the old one. If you don't have the old pump just call the dealer and order one per vin. Also remove lower radiator hose and the radiator should empty out in less than 3 seconds if it's flowing good\n\npull some hoses and check water pump flow if good then look for a blockage in the new radiator\n\nI've seen similar issues with these. Both times the wrong water pump was the problem. When they switched to serpentine belts the pump direction was reversed. Perhaps that was the root cause of the earlier failure.\n\nI shouldn't find your dilemma funny, but I do.Every time I hear Jasper I cringe. Also every time I here about the 4.0L water pump issue I am reminded of when the CW vs. CCW change was made.Back then if you did not purchase new pumps some rebuilders didn't know the difference and craps, what a mess.Now when I hear Jasper I am reminded again.I can still remember the Chrysler tech line telling me that I didn't purge the system correctly.Before I forget, do a flow test of the heater hoses to be certain that you have strong circulation, both into an out of the core.Anyway, I hope this solves your problem.\n\ntry this on the drivers side at the rear of the engine head there is a temp sensor or a plug remove the sensor or plug start engine till coolant come out, temp on those engines generally run higher temps\n\nThinking wrong water pump or a restricted radiator, maybe from those radiator plugs which come on the new radiator.\n\nHi Jamie, Think of your cooling system comprised of three components. Engine cooling jacket, radiator and heater loop. Each part can be tested for flow with a garden hose one component at a time. If there is low flow in one of three or more you know it will overheat. You will get the feel of how much flow to experience with the garden hose flowing. Be sure to reclaim any coolant before you start the process. BMW coolant is good to run after a thorough flush and chase with 100 PSI compressed air. The engine runs clockwise when facing the vibration dampner. Any pulley with the belt on the bottom or on the left will automatically turn CCW. The water pump belt is on the left and it will turn CCW. Good Luck, Gary\n\nWatch the aftermarket radiators could be your issue\n\nI used to own a 1995 XJ Cherokee with a 4.0 engine when I worked at a Jeep dealer a few years ago and had a similar problem with mine....after repeated flushing of the complete system,heater core and 2 different stock replacement radiators I went to my local Car Quest store and ordered an \"extreme duty\" 3 row radiator...may have been 2 but it had double the rows of cooling tubes the stock one had.Problem was solved and no further issues....Also fixed 2 mail route Wranglers with similar problems by doing thatTim Terry Jacks 5 Star Clinic Inc.

Volvo covered the throttlebody for free on the one I had. I hope this helps\n\nThe fuel trims would be a big help. Also, be sure that the boost pressure sensor is working great and the car is actually building boost .

If the volvo scanner does not show them, I have often been surprised to find that FF is available in generic oBD2 data. Weird but true. Sounds like an intake leak that only leaks under the right temp/pressure, and that would be evident in the FF fuel trims.

Sorry more questions than answers with the info you provided. Mark\n\nIt sounds normal to me. If you turn on all the accessories on almost any vehicle at idle it can't keep up and drops to battery voltage. By raising the rpm you enable the alternator to run at full capacity. Are you having any other problems? Battery light lit on dash? .....\n\nHi Mike, If it charges above idle it is probably normal. Have you checked for a loose belt, sometimes they will cause that as well. Try it for a few days and see if it all works out OK. Bob\n\nMike based on the numbers you are giving us that sounds normal- it is very possible to only see 12.5v at idle fully loaded. What type of issue are you having with the car that prompted the alternator replacement? Greg and crew\n\nWhat are the \"voltage drop\" readings of the circuit under load? This should identify the source of the condition.\n\nMike, You may not have as much of a problem as you think. As the other techs said, 12.5 volts at idle with several accessories on is normal. What I have found on many Audis is that there is a significant voltage drop on the positive wire to the battery under load. It sometimes has several connections with corresponding resistance. I usually add an additional wire directly from the B+ terminal on the alternator to the posotive terminal of the battery. One 10 guage wire will usually do the trick and insure good current feed to the battery. Route the wire so it doesn't interfere with anything. Hope this helps.\n\nI think you will find your problem in the PCM.As you know,when full power is demanded by the operator,the PCM detects this and shuts off any high demand power assessories including the battery charging so as to get full bhp from the engine.Your problem is,I think,that the PCM is regulating this feature at the wrong times and I think you should check this section out.\n\nCheck the voltage regulator, it might be faulty, I had a similiar problem. The alternator sounds like it works fine since it shows that it is putting out 14v at times, that is what the alternator should be putting out. The voltage regulator does just that, it regulates how much voltage the alternator is to put out, and it sounds like its shorting out when under a load, and its inexpensive, around $10.\n\nI don't know if this will help, but years ago in Phoenix, Arizona, we discovered that Audi Turbos would run down the battery in three hours or so in very hot weather. The problem was that the alternators did not have the amperage rating to supply enough currant when everything was running in hot conditions. At first, we sent the alternators out to be re-wound for higher amperage, then Audi supplied higher rated alternators. That fixed the problem.\n\nThis might sound stupid, but did you check how the serpentine belt is routed and is it the correct lenght.\n\neither the drive belt around the alternator is slipping or the alternator has a phase out or you have a voltage drop bettween the batt post on the alternator and the battery\n\nI am feeling as though the gentleman who suggested checking the p.c.m. is right. These systems are dependant on control via the p.c.m. and ought to be checked. The thing to do would be to find out what the volatages should be, when at an idle. If it's wrong, I would see about fault tracing the p.c.m.\n\nIf you install a new cluster on the early A6 it does have to be coded properly (4 or 6 cyl. etc.), but there are also some adaptations that have to be carried out. If these are not done you can have lots of problems.\n\nMike ,does the alternator pulley have the one way sprag on it? i have seen problems with these pulleys slipping in the past",

         "yours left balance shaft if balance shaft belt is istall properly the 2 arow(white mark ) will mett on the left side and the right side turn the balancer sproket 3 time by hand and fell the weigt inside when good position suposed to be and arrow by moving sloly clock wise and let go come back to the mark with the balance weigt install timing belt turn 2 time by hand and check timing note yours right side balancer will not be aligned turn 2 more time the crank and now it suposed to be aligned good luck\n\nlooking at the timing area of the engine the gear on the left that has the small belt is lined up with the mark in oil pump the gear on the right i have an easy way to set this up when you spin the balance shaft it will want to stop every 3 times it goes around it will almost want to line up with the mark you will spin it and will stop at the mark thats where you set it up it will only want to stop at the mark every 3rd time .\n\nHi Chris- Here's the information on lining up those balance shafts. By left shaft, I'm assuming you mean the shaft at the front of the car. When you line up the mark on the shaft pulley (at about 11 o'clock), don't worry about using the 6mm pin in the hole (the exhaust is usually in the way, anyways). When the mark is lined up, simply move the pulley slightly off the mark. If the balance weight is at the right spot, the shaft will try to move back to the index mark. If it tries to roll further away from the index, rotate the shaft one revolution, then repeat moving the shaft slightly off the mark; it will try to move back to the mark. The extra step in the timing marks is due to the gear ratio difference in the oil pump drive. The rear shaft is simply lined up with the mark (about 9 o'clock). Cams, crank are as in the manual. Also, don't forget to use www.hmaservice.comfor the factory manual information. Also, check to see the upper belt cover is updated; the new one will have a \"bump\" on the inside of the cover to help keep the belt from jumping time. You may also want to take a close look at the crank sensor and reluctor plate to see if there has been any contact. These have been a problem occasionally, with the CKP failing and the motor stops running. While the belt is off is the time to check it. Finally, check the TSB 03-20-002 for a crank bolt update. Some torque loss can allow the pulley, reluctor and sprocket to move around, wrecking the crank, reluctor and sprocket.\n\nChris, Richard nailed it. Make sure to replace the balance shaft belt and auto tensioner also, verify that the wiring for the crank sensor is tucked out of the way of the T-Belt to prevent rub through, and don't over-tighten the balance shaft belt. The balance shaft belt should have approximately 10mm of \"slack\". If it is too tight it will cause it to \"walk\" wearing it out very quickly and possibly causing severe damage. After it is all reassembled you will need to turn the motor over 6 times by hand for all of the marks to line back up correctly and verify correct timing. Good luck, these aren't too bad once you've done a few.\n\nChris, The balance shaft is driven at a 2:1 ratio through the oil pump. Simply remove the belt, rotate the oil pump gear one full turn and refit the belt. Screwdiver will now enter the hole. Regards, Brian",

         "Hi all. This car we have service for year, this problem has just started once the very cold weather here hit (Below freezing). The first inspection showed no visible signs of fuel leakage. We did find the service bulletin about fuel hoses leaking when cold. We discussed this with the customer that we could not confirm it would fix it, but he was willing to try it. We installed the kit for Subaru and returned the car. The customer stated that within a week (Once the below freezing temps returned) the car once again, on cold start up has a strong fuel smell in the car. We had the customer leave the car overnight, and we removed the rear seat to get at the fuel pump area. Once started, there are a strong burst of a gas smell, but I was unable to get any HC reading with my 4-gas. I mean, it read 00 HC and 0.0 CO. I ran the probe over the gas tank, the fuel cap and filler neck areas, the canister and the engine and fuel filter area's, 0. I talked with the customer about If the car was in a wreck, he stated that he bought this used, did a carfax check, as far as we can tell, no wrecks. In Oregon, we do not have self service, a gas attendant must fill your tank, I asked if he was topping or not, and he stated the he tells then not to top the tank. One last thing, the car is the sedan, not the station wagon model.",
         "Check it with a smoke machine if you have one.\n\nAny exhuast leaks? Smoke evap system.No mention of checking for codes,bad cat maybe.\n\ncheck all fuel hose clamps under the hood especially where hoses connect to rail. tighten all clamps.\n\nCheck REAL close at the fuel line conection at the left forward area of the fuel tank lines near the left rear suspention. The plastic \"quik-connects\" get goffy in the cold weather. It's where they go into the body.\n\nGo around and tighten all fuel line clamps.\n\nOk there really isnt a fix and its not the only car line out there suffering from it. but at temps I think around 18 degrees or colder with some moistuere in the air either when the temp hits this or before hand moisture freezes in the fuel tanks vent system. As a result the fuel vaoprs that are being moved around after start up as the tank vents which is actually quite a bit of expansion as the fuel lines start running around the engine and bring fuel temps up a lot. This Allows all of this to move out of the vent system without being filtered. I see a dozen of these every time we get below 20 degrees and its been moist out. One other place to check is any rubber fuel lines ( especially return lines) at the intake manifold I have heard of several leaking in cold weather. I had a Nissan in on Friday that had a very wet fuel line at the intake when I drove it in cold. After it warmed up the sweating went away. I put a new line on it.\n\nSounds like an evap issue. If you have a smoke machine, smoke it when it's cold. You may have a purge valve sticking closed not allowing it to vent.\n\nI have a 03 forester that my wife drives. we have the same problem with it. I have checked about everything you have and not found any thing no leaks or nothing. I am still looking and if i find the problem i will let you know. or if you find the problem let me know.\n\nI have been fighting this problem on my own car for 6 years. the only way I can beat it is by adjusting the fuel line clamps every year at the begining of winter. I have a few customers that I do the same thing on. I think it is a engine vibration/frequency problem that keeps loosing the clamps just enough and at zero deg cold start due to the different metal's and rubber expansions rates it creats a very slight seep for a few seconds. I am going to convert to all metal lines next year if I get time just for fun. but I have also heard the injector seals shrink also so who knows.\n\nHi Jeff, Very common on these cars. Two short fuel line on both sides of the engine in front of the injector rails. After letting it sit outside over night start the car @ wiggle or put pressure on these lines and you will see them leak. the fuel lines get hard @ crack. good luck John\n\nI had a similar problem with a Rue.I could not get a hc reading anywhere.The smell would come and go.I finally took the filler neck off and cleaned it. There were several small pin holes in it ,replaced it and all is well.\n\nCHECK endwench.com and look for arcilves on wrx fuel smell when cold I replaced the sube cheep clamps with good screw worm clamps and solved the problems without geting the kit. you may have the same problem on the outback. It only leaks when very cold.\n\nWe generally find one or more loose fuel line clamps under the hood in really cold weather. Look closely at the fuel rail by #1 & #3 injectors.

         "Having issues with this 2009 Outback. Great customer has done all recommended maintenance since new. Head gasket has been leaking small amount of oil for past 30K, recently started showing signs of coolant leak(stain, crusty coolant). Customer was on fence on whether to fix or not so took car. 3 weeks later customer called and said temp gauge was 1 line from red. Vehicle came in and we verified low coolant and active leak from head gasket. Customer approve head gasket replacement. Had heads pressure tested and machined. Replaced head gaskets and thermostat as well as timing belt. Vehicle still has overheating concern, runs fine on highway, at slower speeds temp climbs steadily even with cooling fans both running. Shut down vehicle around 230-235 and allow to cool. Limp back to shop. Since this point we have: Performed chemical hydrocarbon test - negative results Replaced thermostat again with Subaru part Replaced radiator with new part Replace water pump Re-torqued head as recommended by our local machine shop Removed heads and replaced gaskets with Felpro head gasketsWhen we remove the new head gaskets the ring around cylinder #4 had a raised spot on both side like a small piece of debris was stuck between the layers so we thought for sure we had it fixed.We have tried both the Subaru bleeding procedure as well as an air-lift vacuum for the cooling system with no change.After each repair vehicle was road tested and same symptom every time. With vehicle in shop cooling fans come on at about 214-215 and go off at 208 after fully warmed up.We have never had this kind of problem with a Subaru before and are completely puzzled by why it is happening.Any and all help would be greatly apprieciated",
         "Some of my questions might be basic but not all info was provided so bear with me.Do cooling fans come on at specified temp,was water pump replaced?Do have adequate coolant flow in radiator[may be clogged].Is there hot and cool spots across radiator[check with infared temp gun],Coolant temp sensor also is switch for fans maybe that was compromised with initial overheating episode.Just some suggestions to lead you in right direction.\n\nHave you checked heater core for blockage?\n\nIt is likely that the original overheat caused silicate from the coolant to drop out and coat the inner surfaces of the radiator tubes. It is an excellent heat insulator and can only be removed by chemical bath. Most techs replace the radiator for this problem if it's Aluminum.Regards, Keith\n\nWe had same issue not long ago and found if you follow the cooling circuit on the vehicle (not info in Alldata), it must pass through the heater core for proper circulation. We replaced the heater core and everything was fine afterwards.\n\nI've had issues bleeding subaru cooling systems in the past. Lift just the front end up after warmed up. With vehicle off undo one of the heater hose clamps and let coolant run out a little. They get air pockets in the heater core\n\nDidn't see any mention of your pressure testing the cooling system. I'd also check the overflow hose for cracks, if it can expel fluid but can't suck it back in, in short order its low on coolant. Also recommend putting a new STANT cap on it and/or pressure testing the old one. Sounds stupid, but make sure fans are spinning correct direction. Subaru had a Yuuuge! problem getting head gaskets to seal and for awhile gave out tins of ground up walnut shells to put into the coolant. Hydrocarbon tests are iffy; the (blue, NAPA) reactant quickly goes bad ON THE SHELF. Need to test it with the C02 from your breath before using.\n\ntry bypassing the heater core as a test.just put the hoses together and see whay you get it could be the core.\n\nSubaru cooling system splits in two halves through the crossover pipe and must be filled from upper hose to avoid air pocket. Test the system with the thermostat removed to confirm the status .\n\nHello , What doesn't make sense to me is that its ok at highway speeds? That would indicate a airflow problem (plenty of air at highway speed). restriction problem should be worse at highway speeds. I guess make sure fans are running high speed and/or up to speed. One other thought is to check temperature difference head to head while its running hot with infrared Good LuckDaniel Salvatore\n\nHave you tried bypassing the heater core. From memory the bypass when thermostat is closed is via heater core\n\nchemical test is not accurate, use a gas analyzer instead. it is much,much accurate than chemical. next, hook the scan tool and compare it with the temperature gauge. sometime you have a false coolant sensor or sensor coated with sediment ot corrosion\n\nEven though you're getting what looks like a good flow of water through the heater core, it's very likely restricted. This is VERY common on the dual zone systems. The passenger side air will be noticeably cooler than the driver's side with the heat on. (As you described).\n\nsounds like a air pocket. try bleeding the system with the heater hose removed so you get all the air out.\n\nIt seems that by bypassing the heater core you have confirmed the diagnosis.Why then would it run hot at lower speeds but not on the highway? Perhaps the restriction in the core is such that at higher RPM, when the pump-discharge pressure increases, the core flow is sufficient.To test this theory, you could run the car in a lower gear at a road speed at which the car would run hot.\n\nThe smallest leak (in the heater core) will result in loss of system pressure. Perhaps it only leaks once it warms up. Suggest U Warm car up with radiator cap off and THEN pressure test it. Unpressurized coolant can boil, and the cooling system no longer works as designed. Result: Overheating. Once it's boiling, big pockets of water vapor DISPLACE coolant in the heater core, so you lose heat. It also forces coolant out into the overflow, and once THAT overflows, onto the ground. Out on the highway, where you don't see it. So now the system is underfilled. Have you got wet carpets, yukky coolant film on inside of windshield (from defrost), any indications of leaking heater core other than lack of heat?\n\nBecause the heater core circuit is vital to the proper flow of coolant in the system. Some vehicles do not have an issue with this, as the core circuit is an 'adjunct' to the system, and is not part of the total flow.To determine a core that is restricted is rather easy. Just measure the temp difference between the two hoses. There should be very little difference, just a few degrees. This signifies that all the tubes are open in the core. As more tubes become restricted, the flow is lessened, resulting in a reduced surface area for heat transfer, and the remaining tubes get too much transfer. The result is a cold core, because it has less internal volume.Example: original core has 200 tubes, and this is the designed surface area for maximum airflow, with good heat transfer. Half the tubes are plugged, resulting in much more heat loss for the open tubes, thus one hose colder than the other. Incidentally, you can also use this method for checking radiators.",

Without codes and accurate diagnostics it can be real expensive to guess.

Can you communicate with the HV battery ECU? If so, check datastream: if the PID for \"delta SOC\" is greater than 20%, the HV battery is degraded and will need to be replaced. The owner may choose to wait until the red triangle appears along with corresponding codes (P3006) but they should prepare for that to happen in the near future. If delta SOC is normal (20%), the turtle light is likely coming on b/c the HV battery is hot. Check the fan (left side of trunk area). What's the weather in NC these days? Any chance they've got a blanket or a pile of beanie babies over the inlet vent (shelf above rear seat)?Best of luck, c\n\nI use the SNAPON SOLUS ULTRA and I am able to go into modules other than ECM or TCM. It sounds like you may have a VSA (Vehicle Steering Angle) issue possibly. I wish I could plug into your Prius to confirm this. I had a vehicle like this the other day. I did the VSA reset by keeping the steering straight....being on perfectly level ground....and VSA resetting. The TRiangle with \"!\" in it disappeared and the steering angle was reset. THis usually is lost if there is a battery disconnect or a traction issue. I hope this helps. God bless.\n\nThere have been some good suggestions so far John. I would add that you should check the oil level. I had a customer with significantly higher mileage (250k) and she never checked the oil level and was always well over normal service interval. The warning would come up in the infotainment screen along with the beeping, but only for 1 second while going around a corner. Turned out out to have 1 quart or less of engine oil.\n\nSurprised you don't have any codes. Those HV battery voltages don't move much by the way. They typically stay about the same voltage from 30-60% SOC. If you were suspicious about the battery, take a movie with the scanner and go load the battery; floor it going uphill or something. If random modules start dropping off on accel or spike high when braking hard, there's a problem. Oh yea, you could check the ABS controller for HV related codes too.

Please describe the exact appearance of the lamp in question.\n\ni agree with most of the replies need to know which light is comming on also if you would have a hv battery going south on you you would have supporting codes also sometimes not being able to get any codes from one or more system only means that that system is off line it can still cause problems and you just cant read it, an easy way to check that is look for data in any of the systems you are checking for codes if you can get data you can get codes if there is none then there is none, on that vintage the steering angle reset may or may not set a code it is easy to do so do it to rule it out even if you had an mg2 problem you should have a code for it however if the problem is mechanical then no code will show all the trany is , is two motors with final drive and planetary unsles it causes a short in the motor windings no code also you could drain the oil in the trans and look for stuff that does not belong therethese are just thoughts based on your info\n\nIf you have red triangle,you have a fault code.

         "This Saab was driving down the road when it started smoking profusely. Was so bad customer had the car towed in. We confirmed the smoke was engine oil by it's color and smell. When the car is started cold there is no smoke until it starts to warm up. If you then rev the engine a couple times it will put out smoke and continue to smoke as long as you let it idle. And it's a lot. At a steady 1500 rpm I thought the fire dept might be stopping by as you could hardly see my building. Removed spark plugs which all were clean. Looked at pistons with bore scope and they are all clean and evenly lightly coated with brown carbon. Removed exhaust pipe at turbo and hoses at inner cooler. All is dry there, ruling out a turbo failure. We ran the car for about a half hour hoping oil fouling would show up but when we pulled the plugs all still looks clean in spite of the smoking. Took off the valve cover and looked at the valve seals which looked intact. Checked crank case pressure which is acceptable and the PCV is sucking what feels to be about the right amount of air volume. There is no oil leaking down the hose which goes back to the air boot at the turbo inlet. Oil level is correct and clean by the way. So we decided to take off the head and inspect the valve guides closer as something obviously broke and changed from all ok to smoking in a moments time. While taking off the head we noticed oil in the intake manifold, heavier on #3 runner where the PCV sucks it's vacuum from directly above it. Which brings us back to the breather but what? There is a baffle in the valve cover which is intact and appears to be there to stop oil from going into the inlet of the pcv fitting. With the Fitting out of the valve cover and the engine running it isn't spitting any oil out. Just a little blow by but not excessive. Well by the time we saw the intake the head was almost off so we finished removing it and found everything to be pretty nice, including newer valve stem seals. The head looks like it has been off within the last few years even though our cust has only had this car six months. I wish now we had run the car much longer with the PCV out of the VC to see if the smoking was less but hindsight is 20-20. We are replacing the VS seals and putting the head back on now, convinced the problem lies elsewhere, but where?Does this scenario ring a bell with any of you Saab guys?We are totally baffled at this point.Thanks",
         "check for a restriction at the air inlet to the filter housing. this can cause a vacuum to be drawn in the air intake boot and may suck oil in through the breather Try running it with the air filter housing open and see if it still smokes.\n\nIt's almost always the turbo. It can leak oil into the intake, or into the exhaust. Just because you don't see oil on the exhaust side, doesn't mean the oil isn't leaking into the intake. The amount of smoke, and the rapid onset of the problem, are pretty classic symptoms. Good luck, Dave\n\nIt has been awhile but, there is a black plastic box in the PCV system that has some sort of valve in it that goes bad and allows oil to be sucked up and burned. Call the SAAB dealer, it is a common fault and they stock them.\n\nhas anybody checked the pcv valve? if it allows turbo pressure thru it will suck oil into the intake\n\ntwo things can happen one is the turbo. pop off the intake tube and wiggel the shaft if it is loose that is your issue two pull all the plugs is #1 cyl wet the others dry? the head gasket breaks bettween the timing chain galley and the # 1 cyl. on the intake stroke it pulss oil in sortt wants to go back to its two stroke roots good luck\n\nIts the TURBO. The oil seal on the exhaust side is bad leaking oil directly into the exhaust, Very common. If the engine was burning that much it would foul the spark plugs. Put the head back on and replace the turbo.\n\nstill think it is the turbo, did you check the intercooler for oil?\n\nfirst of all, did you check for impeller play when you dropped the headpuipe? It still sounds like turbo...The only other thing with the pcv is if the vacuum check valve is blown out- one way check valve to stop pressureizing the crankcase under boost- in the vacuum purge line. Also, what does the bore look like in #3?- possibly rings?\n\nSure sounds like the turbo has failed and is allowing oil to enter the exhaust causing the smoke.\n\nIt doesn't take much oil getting past the turbine seals to make a lot of smoke, and if it leaks into the exhaust side there will be little or no evidence in the engine, the heat in the turbo and catalytic converter burns it all. Time for a turbo.\n\nreplace turbo. one time i had one in my shop like that i sent my tech out in it to ck it. he went up on the freeway witch i can see from my desk and it stopped traffic up there in both directions. by the time he got to an exit and turned around and got back here, there was a chp helicopter buzzing our building. he had followed him back. we have changed many saab turbos for this problem its leaking oil on the exhaust side and taking directly to a hot cat. good luck\n\nsounds like a bad turbo, maybe a leak at he head gasket or a broken piston, Did you do a leak down test?\n\nsounds like turbo leaking into exhaust,some exhaust manifolds have a screw in plug between head and turbo, at times when not sure I have removed the plug and no smoke from engine but lots of smoke out the exhaust so changed the turbo...hth jerry",

         "Customer brought car in to check for a one time no crank no start do to a discharged battery. She thought she might have left something on and the problem has not reoccured. The battery was relatively new, was charged and tested fine. We only got 13.6 volts at the battery. The key off draw was 250 ma even after 2 hours. It goes below 10 ma with the LIN wire unplugged from the alternator. There are CAN comunication codes for communication with the alternator and battery monitoring control module J367. The VAS5052 walked us through a simple test. With J367 unplugged there was still no communication to the alternator. With the alternator LIN plug disconnected there is communication with J367. The 5052 advised us to replace the alternator once we confiirmed the LIN wire was not open or shorted to ground or positive. Easier said than done. The Audi part number on the alternator is not what ETKA calls for. We confirmed this with the dealer. Our car has plug for the LIN connector. The called for alternator has an eyelet connector. For price reasons we opted for a new Valeo as opposed to a factory Audi unit. The draw is down to 80 mamp but the codes are still present and the test procedure condemns the alternator again. WTF!",
         "its common on vw/audi for the alternator to draw current and kill battery, just replace the alternator..\n\nreplace alternator ,draw is to high\n\n80 m amps is too high - quiscent current should not be over 50m amps after all modules have gone to sleep mode - takes around 50mnts with all functions closed & doors, bonnet, trunk lid closed - the car has an alternator with a LIN line and this is also a giving out a signal - since this is now not being received from the new alternator that you have installed the LIN will not go into sleep mode and will keep hunting for the signal - check ETKA again via the F1 function with full VIN no - if still does not display the correct part no then use the PR conditions to choose the right part or send a feedback mail via ETKA they will give you the correct part - raise the ticket on this VIN with attachment of freeze frame data highlighting the part required\n\nwith the low mileage and the fact that the wrong alternator was installed and the non correct battery i would advise your customer the cost to restore the car to the correct battery and alternator and then see what the issue is most likely a bad alternator to begin with these people buy these and think they are cheap to fix get a can test box and see if all the networks are going to sleep after an hour if you put a less expensive alternator in you are looking at a come back vehicle\n\nId agree with all the statements above. These vehicles reqire the correct parts installed for them not to have any issues. Sometimes even the oem part is the only way to go. As far as coding the battery to the vehicle this is a vital part in Audi VW Porsche battery replacment. The battery manager used the info from the battery to detmin faulty battery, current draw, etc... say you just went ahead and replaced the battery due to being dead and never coded it to the vehicle... the battery manager would never know the difference and the vehicle may continue to no respond correctly. If you have a oe scan tool or similar then you should be able to code the battery thru 19 module. If you are unsure of any of this id recommend a visit to the dealer. Good luck and keep us updated.\n\nyou can make up a serial number it has to be 10 digits,and not the same as the old one,to start with\n\nIf you do not do it, then ecu will not know capacity in Ah, or not updated counters, or charge state. Car should run, it may result in under charge or overcharge battery, if the Ah (ampere hour) capacity is different. Pleae go to Ross tech web site for coding instructions.\n\nYou should be able to get a Bosch reman alternator for not too much more than the El Cheapo. I show them for $229. As for the serial number...I don't see any way to do this other than find and Audi battery of the same rating and use that serial number.\n\nJust went with the same issue with my current shop for a z4 and lin bus fault post alt replacement.. i dont like valeo and bosh components rather have dealer parts..yesterday i had a faulty new starter from bosh it blew fuse for cas(bmw) what a head acheSent from Yahoo Mail on Android",

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your issue with the rear door locks and gas door not operating on your 1997 BMW 740iL, here are some troubleshooting steps to try:\n\n1. Check the fuses in the trunk near the battery - these are separate from the main fuse box. The fuel door actuator often blows a fuse when it fails, which can disable the entire central locking system.\n\n2. When checking fuses, be careful with the blade-type fuses as they can sometimes crack rather than completely blow. Testing with a test light might temporarily push the cracked fuse closed, giving a false \"good\" reading.\n\n3. Try disconnecting the gas door actuator and recheck the system. Failed fuel door actuators are known to cause system-wide issues.\n\n4. Perform a system reset: disconnect the battery cables and touch them together through a 10 ohm, 1-watt resistor for a few minutes, then reconnect.\n\n5. If you need to test the General Module (body control unit) directly, the lock signals for the rear doors and gas door are on pins 13 (black wire, ~12 gauge) and 14 (blue wire, ~12 gauge) of the large connector. The module is located behind the glove box.\n\n6. Try removing the central lock fuse to see if the doors will open manually.\n\n7. Check if unlocking through the trunk with the key opens just the front doors or all doors - this can help diagnose the issue.\n\nIf all these steps fail, you may be dealing with a faulty General Module.\n</ANSWER>"

Pin test all components at the TCM - check both inputs and outputs to verify if the TCM is receiving correct signals but sending incorrect ones.\n\n2. If your scan tool has the capability, try activating the solenoid with the engine off - you should hear a faint click if it's working properly.\n\n3. Check for a similar solenoid from Volvo - they use the same one in some of their transmissions at about half the price, and it's relatively easy to replace.\n\n4. Remember that a circuit can show good resistance on a multimeter but still break down under actual current load.\n\nIf all tests check out and the code persists immediately upon key-on, then a TCM replacement might be your next step.

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your symptoms, it sounds like you have a fuel-related issue rather than a security problem. Here's what I'd recommend:\n\n1. Check your fuel quality - drain a sample and inspect for water or diesel contamination. The fact that it runs on ether but fouls plugs with fuel suggests contaminated fuel.\n\n2. Verify fuel pressure readings - what were the pressure numbers before changing the pump?\n\n3. Consider checking for exhaust restrictions:\n   - Remove upper O2 sensors to see if providing an exhaust path helps\n   - Check for plugged catalytic converters\n\n4. Since you're getting spark and fuel delivery, also check:\n   - Compression test (fuel washing down cylinders can reduce compression)\n   - MAF sensor readings\n   - Camshaft position sensor readings\n   - Timing chain alignment (verify cam and crank marks)\n   - Large vacuum leaks or stuck EGR valve\n\n5. Try disconnecting the MAF plug and throttle body connectors - the engine should run/idle (without throttle response). This can help diagnose if those components are causing issues.\n\nThe fact that it runs on ether but won't stay running strongly points to fuel quality or a restriction in the exhaust system.

Since you've already replaced the water pump and thermostat (both aftermarket and OEM), and the dealer has replaced the head gaskets and decked the heads, the most likely culprit is a restricted radiator.\n\nWith 110,000+ miles on this Trooper, the radiator tubes are likely partially clogged or restricted. This would explain why the vehicle overheats faster at higher speeds (increased load on the engine with inadequate cooling).\n\nHere's what I recommend:\n1. Have the radiator flow-checked or inspected by a radiator shop. It's likely that 50% or more of the tubes are plugged.\n2. Check for any debris or matting between the condenser and radiator that could be blocking airflow.\n3. Verify the fan clutch is functioning properly - a slipping fan clutch can cause overheating issues.\n4. If you haven't already, check for HC in the cooling system again to rule out continued head gasket issues.\n\nIf the radiator inspection shows restrictions, replacing the radiator is your best course of action. Even though the heads were serviced, there's also a small possibility of cracks in the heads or block that weren't detected during the repair.\n</ANSWER>"

         "Answer the following question after understanding the specifics of the vehicle in question.\n\nIt is a 2007 Lexus GX470 4.7L Right Head. with the VIN JTJBT20X370148174 and a mileage of 143,000 mi. This 2007 Lexus GX470 is a 4.7L / 8 cyl / Gas engine with 5-speed Automatic Transmission (Electronic) transmission.\nDelivery system: Fuel Injection Affected component: Right Head Conditions: Always",
         "I have this Lexus that came in with a blown timing belt and an overheat.The customer asked on the phone if we did that kind of work and although I try to stay away from full replacement we do head work all the time.Upon inspection the overheat was bad enough to crack the radiator.Talked the owner into a low mile (80000) motor.Normally would not do the job but she reminded me of her large towing expense and I did tell her on the phone we did \"engine\" work.We installed a new water pump/timing belt to be safe.Upon start up it had what sounded like a stuck lifter.The salvage yard requested that we drive it and see if it came out of it.After a week the noise is still there.Had the tech change the oil again with a Toyota filter and check valve clearance(these are not hydraulic lifters but a shimmed tappet.The noise seems be coming from the front of the right head though you hear it through the wheel well.Shorting out cylinders makes no change.Also checked for bent rods.I understand they had some wrist pin issues with this engine but it sounds too light in my opinion.Tried top engine cleaner and a borocope down the plug hole and came up empty. The salvage yard claims it was quiet when it left and would like a diagnosis before they decide what they want us to do.I will try to post an audio/video tomorrow but just looking for any common problems for now.Thanks in advance.",
         "sound like a bad lifter.\n\nChris, they don't have lifters. You could run it with the rocker cover off and see for anything obvious. Could it be a vvti problem? If this has it? Did the motor come with an intake? Could something be dropped down the intake port?\n\nI would check the cam shaft scissor gear for alignment, you should use a bolt to hold the alignment.Good luck Shawn\n\nHad a tech let one of these engines eat something ( don't know what ) but what ever it was knocked 1 valve keeper out of 2 different valve. believe it or not it didn't drop a valve. It was on the right side also. Good luck. Mark\n\nYou have t check the valve clearance cold. And did your tech find any shims not to spec? These things do make noise when the gap is to large and a proper shim may be all you need.\n\nI agree with Wayne from Florida. These are typically good motors and not an issue with a used one. However, it is not impossible that someone had messed with the engine prior to you receiving it. A simple test you can do to check if it is in the valves is to temporarily change the viscosity of the oil. This may change the noise and may help you get closer to finding the cause.\n\nThose cam gears have to be preloaded and a bolt placed into the gear to lock in place before installed. Once installed you can remove the bolt and it will be ok otherwise you get a noise. It could be that. Might be time to pull the pan and check the inside for bearing material. I had a Tundra that made a noise that sounded upper end and it had bearing material in the bottom of the pan when I pulled it. Toyota told me it's not uncommon to think it's coming from the upper end when it's bottom end one an all aluminum Toyota engine as the sound resonates. Just thinking top of my head here former Toyota dealer tech.\n\nTry to pinpoint which bank is the noise source. If it sound like a metallic ticking noise with the rhythm of a valve opening than you have to pull the cylinder head and reseat ( lap) the valves. Remove the camshaft and lifters and open and close the valves. See if the noise of closing the valve manually is the same. Other option is to red line the engine few times for several seconds. If something was trapped into the piston head may need to be seated. It is an easy friendly engine to work on. Unfortunately seems like you not getting paid for this. Good luck!",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, this sounds like a valve train issue in the right cylinder head. Since the 2007 GX470 doesn't use hydraulic lifters but shimmed tappets, here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Check valve clearances while cold - improper clearance can cause ticking noises that sound like lifter problems\n\n2. Inspect the VVT-i system - this could be causing the noise if there's an issue with the cam gear\n\n3. Examine the camshaft scissor gear alignment - these should be properly aligned with a bolt during installation\n\n4. Remove the rocker cover and visually inspect while running to pinpoint the exact source\n\n5. Check for possible valve keeper issues - there have been cases where these engines lost valve keepers without dropping valves\n\n6. Consider pulling the oil pan to check for bearing material - sometimes what sounds like top-end noise in Toyota aluminum engines is actually bottom-end related\n\n7. Try changing oil viscosity temporarily as a diagnostic test\n\n8. Inspect for foreign objects that may have fallen into the intake port\n\nSince the salvage yard claims it was quiet before installation, focus on things that could have changed during the swap. The fact that shorting cylinders makes no difference suggests it's likely mechanical in the valve train rather than combustion-related.\n</ANSWER>"

       "Based on your description of a recurring transmission fluid leak from the bellhousing on this 2000 Subaru Outback, there are several potential causes to investigate:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Worn torque converter support bushing - This is a common issue that can cause misalignment of the converter with the seal, creating leaks even after replacing the seal. When the bushing wears, it doesn't hold the converter true in the seal.\n",

       "\n",
       "4. Pipe seal behind the oil seal - There's a seal that wraps around the oil pump shaft separating the gear oil compartment of the front differential. This requires separating the bellhousing for access.\n",

       "1. Check the ignition switch - The 97-98 900s have the \"old\" style switch (part #4409553) which is a common failure point. When these fail, they can cause intermittent power interruptions to various control modules, explaining why you're getting warning lights but no stored codes.

       "\n",
       "3. Check voltage readings - Try monitoring voltage readings on the Tech 2 under read values/activate of the ABS system. If you see fluctuating voltage (around 10V), this further points to the ignition switch.\n",

       "4. Try Generic OBDII mode - Sometimes codes only show up in Generic OBDII mode rather than the Saab-specific diagnostics.\n",
       "\n",
       "The fact that you're seeing both transmission and ABS warning lights with no stored codes strongly suggests an electrical supply issue rather than actual component failures.

I removed all the fuses and relays in the junction box under the dash and still had a draw. I removed all the main power cables to the junction box and still had a draw. I traced the cable back and found the command start was tied into that wire. I found two relays that were part of the starter and one was powered up and engaged at all times. I unhooked power to the relay and the draw went away. It was 19mA. I reassembled all components and retested for a draw. It was back, 230mA. I removed the command start completely and all the related wiring harnesses. I returned it to stock. No damaged or shorted wires were found. During this I found the DVD player was wired into the command start wiring. I removed it as well. The draw a was gone. Again I reassembled and the draw came back. Now I had the draw even when I unhooked the cable at the under hood junction box. I disassembled and broke down the junction box. I found I had a draw for the front blower motor and rear blower motor controller. When I unhooked the motor and controller my draw went away. I removed the control wire from the front blower motor and plugged it back in. The draw was gone for about 10 seconds and returned. I unhooked the blower motor and the draw was gone. The same thing in the rear. I left them unhooked and the draw came back. Plugging them back in didn't change the draw. I now had my draw from the short bar to the four fuses that are after it. The Radio 1, CRT, ECU B, and Dome. If I unplugged all the fuses my draw was gone, but if I plugged any one fuse in the draw came back. I decided since the draw was moving I may have a grounding issue. Prior to this I unplugged the NAV (radio) unit and the dome lights, etc. I still had a draw if I plugged one of the fuses in. I also monitored it over night to make sure I wasn't just not waiting long enough. We have had the vehicle in the shop for over a week now. I removed all the grounds and cleaned, dielectric greased and tightened them. There are a lot of grounds. I have this truck completely apart.

Good Luck, Dennis Durand Swansea,Ma.</td><td><ANSWER>\n",
       "Based on your description, it sounds like you're concerned about the timing marks being 180 degrees out when the crank is at TDC. This is actually normal for a 4-stroke engine - the cam turns at half the speed of the crankshaft, so every other revolution will show the cam mark 180 degrees out.\n",

       "- Fuel is within specs (32-39 psi)\n",
       "- Timing appears correct\n",
       "\n",
       "Here are some things to check:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Verify you're on the compression stroke for cylinder #1 when checking timing. You can put a paper towel in the #1 plug hole and bump the starter - when it blows out, you're approaching compression TDC.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Check that the distributor is properly indexed. The rotor should be pointing to #1 when the engine is at TDC compression stroke. Some Jeep models had timing changes between years, so the distributor timing might need adjustment.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Verify you have adequate injector pulse - you have fuel pressure, but are the injectors actually firing?\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Check fuel quality and look for contamination.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. Test the spark strength - you have spark, but is it strong enough?\n",
       "\n",
       "The fact that your compression is good (150 psi) indicates the mechanical timing is likely correct. If timing was significantly off, you wouldn't have good compression readings.\n",

It's still got the original factory drums, in excellent shape. I cut them, and they still drag mustily, in forward rotation. I kept releasing the adjustment back, with no avail. The parking brake cables are fine, and lose. Once you remove the torque from the wheel nuts, the problem is gone. After I kept releasing the adjustment, and still dragging, I took the wheel off, and the drum was very lose on the brake shoes. I used a WBR brake shoes from world pack, because the grab better than regular shoes. They look like a metallic compound in the shoes. The shoes are installed correct, the short one in the front, that is how they come out, and people on you Tube said. Is there a proportional valve in the back that could do this? I haven't tried to open the bleeder. The fact that the removal of the wheel, gives the slack back, makes me believe, that the torque of the wheel appears to cause it. Can't make the connection to this. It didn't have this problem before. Thanks for any help you can provide. Alfie.</td><td>Sounds like the brake drum is contacting something - most likely the outer edge of the brake shoes or the backing plate. Bolt the drums on with the lug nuts and turn the drums several times, then take them off and look for witness marks. It might help to put paint on the likely interference surfaces if the first try doesn't show you what's contacting. I don't like the idea of using brake shoes that \"grab better\" than OE, especially on rear brakes.

I got this cat here with a ABS/ Stability Ctl./ Traction control message. Also, the speedometer is intermittently inop, when speedo is inop, Transmission Failure message appears,( obviously), no speed signal= no Trans control, cool. This particular car has a Mercedes Benz tranny 722.635 which we have rebuilt many and we know the transmission is good, we even took the valve body out and replaced the solenoids and both turbine speed sensors. Now, I got 2 questions for you guys: does the speedo on this Jag take speed info from the ABS module like the Benz does? if so, I know what to look for next. Does anyone know FOR SURE? not guessing, Alldata, Mitchell 5, and Autodata have very poor diagrams on this system and I hate to pay $200 to use manufacturers website. Second question: The wheel speed sensors on this car are OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE, has anyone found a cheap replacement for them (like Ford, MBZ, or any other sensor that might work? I got to get the ABS module working before I can get CAN readings. I'm not all for hacking cars but Im trying to do a little more affordable troubleshooting. Thanks. P.S the part # for the sensor is LJA2226AA</td><td>If you get a C1095 and codes for the front wheel speed sensors from the ABS control module, then it is most likely a bad ABS module. BTW, its usually the harness not the sensor if it does come down to sensor issues. Jag was smart enough to make the harness relaceable. I do believe the primary speed data is sent accross the CAN network from the ABS module. However, if the data is missing it will calculate from other sources.\n",

       "Several key points to help you:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Yes, the speedometer on your Jag does take speed information from the ABS module via the CAN network. When this data is missing, the car will try to calculate from other sources, which explains your intermittent speedometer and transmission failure messages.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. For the wheel speed sensors (part #LJA2226AA), before replacing the expensive sensors themselves, check the harnesses first. Multiple techs confirm that it's usually the harnesses that fail, not the sensors themselves. Jaguar designed these with replaceable harnesses, which is much more cost-effective.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Diagnostic approach:\n",
       "   - Use a proper scan tool that can interface with Jaguar systems to pull ABS/TCS codes\n",
       "   - Check the fly leads going to the sensors by disconnecting at both the sensor and engine compartment ends, then ohm out the wires\n",
       "   - Inspect the torque of rear axle nuts (loose nuts can cause the ABS ring to spin freely)\n",
       "   - Look for dry soldered joints at the pump wiring on the circuit board in the ABS module\n",
       "\n",
       "4. If the ABS module itself is bad, consider using BBA Reman who can fix them for less than $200, which is much cheaper than a new unit. Using your original repaired unit avoids programming issues that might occur with a replacement unit.\n",

Does the controller apply vacuum w/a single control solinoid or does it have multiple solinoids for the various doors inside the controller? If it has multiple lock control solinoids in the controller that is seems posible that the lock on the pass front door could be an intermittant non op due to vacuum holding on this door and be the fault of the controller.Tsb and Iatn archive searches found nothing on this trouble.Visual inspection of the latch and solinoid assembly show nothing (High tech modular assemblies! do they think this thing is going to the moon or what?)(Crack does more than kill)What do you think?

       "Hi Jamie, Think of your cooling system comprised of three components. Engine cooling jacket, radiator and heater loop. Each part can be tested for flow with a garden hose one component at a time. If there is low flow in one of three or more you know it will overheat. You will get the feel of how much flow to experience with the garden hose flowing. Be sure to reclaim any coolant before you start the process. BMW coolant is good to run after a thorough flush and chase with 100 PSI compressed air. The engine runs clockwise when facing the vibration dampner. Any pulley with the belt on the bottom or on the left will automatically turn CCW. The water pump belt is on the left and it will turn CCW. Good Luck, Gary\n",

       "wrong waterpump or belt miss routed and turning wrong way</td><td><ANSWER>\n",
       "Based on your symptoms, there are several potential causes for your Jeep Cherokee running hot:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Water Pump Issues**: This is the most likely culprit. The 4.0L Jeep engines can use two different water pumps (clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation). Even though your pump has the \"R\" stamp and turns CCW, it might still be the wrong pump for your application. Compare it with an OEM pump specifically for your VIN.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Cooling System Blockage**: Check for:\n",
       "   - Shipping plugs left in the new radiator\n",
       "   - Clogged heater core (try bypassing it temporarily)\n",
       "   - Blockage in the lower radiator hose\n",
       "   - Restricted radiator flow\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Air in the System**: These Jeeps often require a vacuum coolant fill to properly purge air. Air pockets can prevent proper circulation.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Radiator Capacity**: The stock radiator may not be sufficient. Some owners have solved similar issues by upgrading to a higher capacity aftermarket radiator with more cooling rows.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Belt Routing**: Verify the belt is routed correctly. It's possible to have tension but incorrect routing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Troubleshooting steps:\n",
       "- Flow test the heater hoses (should have strong circulation even at idle)\n",
       "- Remove the lower radiator hose to check flow (should empty in under 3 seconds)\n",
       "- Try installing a known OEM water pump ordered by your VIN\n",
       "- Consider upgrading to a higher capacity radiator\n",

       "Delivery system: Fuel Injection Affected component: Abs Conditions: Light On</td><td>Hello folks,I have this 3000 gt with an ABS light that comes on when vehicle is started. The diagnostic procedure envolves checking abs light with key on and when in the start position. The light flashes twice and shuts off in the run position. It stayes on in the start position (clutch pedal not depressed so engine will not start) and then when put back into the run position the light flashes and shuts back off. This indicates to check for power from instument cluster to pin 25 of ABS ECU. I tested for power and found only 2 volts and not battery voltage. Before I disassembly the dash on this vehicle, I wanted to get some feedback and see if anyone has seen this before. I removed instrument cluster and check for cont from dash pin to pin 25 and found none. I am not sure if I am checking the correct harness because the description isnt great in either alldata or mitchel. Thanks</td><td>has this vehicle ever been in an accident??...i say this because your symptoms sound like an unstable on nonexistent ground...have you checked the ground locations for the abs system throuch its controller???because you are showing only two volts on this circuit you checked, i would assume continuity...however, many of these systems rely on the base ground circuit fot the controller and then at the ecm in case of a break... just a thought steve\n",

       "how much other checks have you done? there are 4 fuses for abs controller, have you visually inspected speed sensors at wheels (usually can find a broken wire for sensor) if wires are good and fuses are good can you communicate with controller? dtc's? if not able to communicate at abs controller ohm each speed sensor check powers and grounds at controller (check with halogen bulb) usually this show something\n",

       "What are the \"voltage drop\" readings of the circuit under load? This should identify the source of the condition.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mike, You may not have as much of a problem as you think. As the other techs said, 12.5 volts at idle with several accessories on is normal. What I have found on many Audis is that there is a significant voltage drop on the positive wire to the battery under load. It sometimes has several connections with corresponding resistance. I usually add an additional wire directly from the B+ terminal on the alternator to the posotive terminal of the battery. One 10 guage wire will usually do the trick and insure good current feed to the battery. Route the wire so it doesn't interfere with anything. Hope this helps.\n",

       "\n",
       "Check the voltage regulator, it might be faulty, I had a similiar problem. The alternator sounds like it works fine since it shows that it is putting out 14v at times, that is what the alternator should be putting out. The voltage regulator does just that, it regulates how much voltage the alternator is to put out, and it sounds like its shorting out when under a load, and its inexpensive, around $10.\n",

       "I don't know if this will help, but years ago in Phoenix, Arizona, we discovered that Audi Turbos would run down the battery in three hours or so in very hot weather.

At first, we sent the alternators out to be re-wound for higher amperage, then Audi supplied higher rated alternators. That fixed the problem.\n",

       "Most vehicles, including Audis, can struggle to maintain full charging voltage at idle when all accessories are running. The 120 amp alternator in your A6 simply can't produce its full output at idle speeds. This is why the voltage increases to 14V when you rev the engine - the alternator can then generate its full capacity.\n",

       "\n",
       "Hi Chris- Here's the information on lining up those balance shafts. By left shaft, I'm assuming you mean the shaft at the front of the car. When you line up the mark on the shaft pulley (at about 11 o'clock), don't worry about using the 6mm pin in the hole (the exhaust is usually in the way, anyways). When the mark is lined up, simply move the pulley slightly off the mark. If the balance weight is at the right spot, the shaft will try to move back to the index mark. If it tries to roll further away from the index, rotate the shaft one revolution, then repeat moving the shaft slightly off the mark; it will try to move back to the mark. The extra step in the timing marks is due to the gear ratio difference in the oil pump drive. The rear shaft is simply lined up with the mark (about 9 o'clock). Cams, crank are as in the manual. Also, don't forget to use www.hmaservice.comfor the factory manual information. Also, check to see the upper belt cover is updated; the new one will have a \"bump\" on the inside of the cover to help keep the belt from jumping time. You may also want to take a close look at the crank sensor and reluctor plate to see if there has been any contact. These have been a problem occasionally, with the CKP failing and the motor stops running. While the belt is off is the time to check it. Finally, check the TSB 03-20-002 for a crank bolt update. Some torque loss can allow the pulley, reluctor and sprocket to move around, wrecking the crank, reluctor and sprocket.\n",
       "\n",
       "Chris, Richard nailed it. Make sure to replace the balance shaft belt and auto tensioner also, verify that the wiring for the crank sensor is tucked out of the way of the T-Belt to prevent rub through, and don't over-tighten the balance shaft belt. The balance shaft belt should have approximately 10mm of \"slack\". If it is too tight it will cause it to \"walk\" wearing it out very quickly and possibly causing severe damage. After it is all reassembled you will need to turn the motor over 6 times by hand for all of the marks to line back up correctly and verify correct timing. Good luck, these aren't too bad once you've done a few.\n",

This car we have service for year, this problem has just started once the very cold weather here hit (Below freezing). The first inspection showed no visible signs of fuel leakage. We did find the service bulletin about fuel hoses leaking when cold. We discussed this with the customer that we could not confirm it would fix it, but he was willing to try it. We installed the kit for Subaru and returned the car. The customer stated that within a week (Once the below freezing temps returned) the car once again, on cold start up has a strong fuel smell in the car. We had the customer leave the car overnight, and we removed the rear seat to get at the fuel pump area. Once started, there are a strong burst of a gas smell, but I was unable to get any HC reading with my 4-gas. I mean, it read 00 HC and 0.0 CO. I ran the probe over the gas tank, the fuel cap and filler neck areas, the canister and the engine and fuel filter area's, 0. I talked with the customer about If the car was in a wreck, he stated that he bought this used, did a carfax check, as far as we can tell, no wrecks. In Oregon, we do not have self service, a gas attendant must fill your tank, I asked if he was topping or not, and he stated the he tells then not to top the tank.

As a result the fuel vaoprs that are being moved around after start up as the tank vents which is actually quite a bit of expansion as the fuel lines start running around the engine and bring fuel temps up a lot. This Allows all of this to move out of the vent system without being filtered. I see a dozen of these every time we get below 20 degrees and its been moist out. One other place to check is any rubber fuel lines ( especially return lines) at the intake manifold I have heard of several leaking in cold weather.

       "1. Fuel line clamps - The most common culprit. In cold weather, different expansion rates between metals and rubber can cause slight seepage. Check and tighten all fuel line clamps, especially:\n",
       "   - Near the fuel rail connections (particularly by #1 and #3 injectors)\n",
       "   - Under the hood where hoses connect to the rail\n",
       "   - At the fuel filter\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Plastic quick-connects - Examine the fuel line connections at the left forward area of the fuel tank near the left rear suspension. These plastic connectors often become problematic in cold weather.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Short fuel lines - Look at the two short fuel lines on both sides of the engine in front of the injector rails. These can harden and crack in cold weather. Try wiggling or applying pressure to these lines after a cold start to see if they leak.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Fuel tank vent system - At temperatures around 18°F or colder, moisture can freeze in the fuel tank's vent system. This prevents proper filtering of fuel vapors during the expansion that occurs after a cold start.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. EVAP system issues - Consider checking the purge valve, which might be sticking closed and not allowing proper venting.\n",

       "Even though you're getting what looks like a good flow of water through the heater core, it's very likely restricted. This is VERY common on the dual zone systems. The passenger side air will be noticeably cooler than the driver's side with the heat on. (As you described).\n",

Perhaps the restriction in the core is such that at higher RPM, when the pump-discharge pressure increases, the core flow is sufficient.To test this theory, you could run the car in a lower gear at a road speed at which the car would run hot.\n",
       "\n",
       "The smallest leak (in the heater core) will result in loss of system pressure. Perhaps it only leaks once it warms up. Suggest U Warm car up with radiator cap off and THEN pressure test it. Unpressurized coolant can boil, and the cooling system no longer works as designed. Result: Overheating. Once it's boiling, big pockets of water vapor DISPLACE coolant in the heater core, so you lose heat. It also forces coolant out into the overflow, and once THAT overflows, onto the ground. Out on the highway, where you don't see it. So now the system is underfilled. Have you got wet carpets, yukky coolant film on inside of windshield (from defrost), any indications of leaking heater core other than lack of heat?\n",

       "Because the heater core circuit is vital to the proper flow of coolant in the system. Some vehicles do not have an issue with this, as the core circuit is an 'adjunct' to the system, and is not part of the total flow.To determine a core that is restricted is rather easy. Just measure the temp difference between the two hoses. There should be very little difference, just a few degrees. This signifies that all the tubes are open in the core. As more tubes become restricted, the flow is lessened, resulting in a reduced surface area for heat transfer, and the remaining tubes get too much transfer. The result is a cold core, because it has less internal volume.Example: original core has 200 tubes, and this is the designed surface area for maximum airflow, with good heat transfer. Half the tubes are plugged, resulting in much more heat loss for the open tubes, thus one hose colder than the other. Incidentally, you can also use this method for checking radiators.</td><td><ANSWER>\n",

Was so bad customer had the car towed in. We confirmed the smoke was engine oil by it's color and smell. When the car is started cold there is no smoke until it starts to warm up. If you then rev the engine a couple times it will put out smoke and continue to smoke as long as you let it idle. And it's a lot. At a steady 1500 rpm I thought the fire dept might be stopping by as you could hardly see my building. Removed spark plugs which all were clean. Looked at pistons with bore scope and they are all clean and evenly lightly coated with brown carbon. Removed exhaust pipe at turbo and hoses at inner cooler. All is dry there, ruling out a turbo failure. We ran the car for about a half hour hoping oil fouling would show up but when we pulled the plugs all still looks clean in spite of the smoking. Took off the valve cover and looked at the valve seals which looked intact. Checked crank case pressure which is acceptable and the PCV is sucking what feels to be about the right amount of air volume. There is no oil leaking down the hose which goes back to the air boot at the turbo inlet. Oil level is correct and clean by the way. So we decided to take off the head and inspect the valve guides closer as something obviously broke and changed from all ok to smoking in a moments time. While taking off the head we noticed oil in the intake manifold, heavier on #3 runner where the PCV sucks it's vacuum from directly above it. Which brings us back to the breather but what? There is a baffle in the valve cover which is intact and appears to be there to stop oil from going into the inlet of the pcv fitting. With the Fitting out of the valve cover and the engine running it isn't spitting any oil out. Just a little blow by but not excessive. Well by the time we saw the intake the head was almost off so we finished removing it and found everything to be pretty nice, including newer valve stem seals. The head looks like it has been off within the last few years even though our cust has only had this car six months. I wish now we had run the car much longer with the PCV out of the VC to see if the smoking was less but hindsight is 20-20. We are replacing the VS seals and putting the head back on now, convinced the problem lies elsewhere, but where?Does this scenario ring a bell with any of you Saab guys?We are totally baffled at this point.Thanks</td><td>check for a restriction at the air inlet to the filter housing. this can cause a vacuum to be drawn in the air intake boot and may suck oil in through the breather Try running it with the air filter housing open and see if it still smokes.\n",
       "\n",
       "It's almost always the turbo. It can leak oil into the intake, or into the exhaust. Just because you don't see oil on the exhaust side, doesn't mean the oil isn't leaking into the intake. The amount of smoke, and the rapid onset of the problem, are pretty classic symptoms. Good luck, Dave\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Its the TURBO. The oil seal on the exhaust side is bad leaking oil directly into the exhaust, Very common. If the engine was burning that much it would foul the spark plugs. Put the head back on and replace the turbo.\n",

       "Based on the symptoms you're describing, this is almost certainly a failing turbo. Here's why:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. The sudden onset of heavy smoke is a classic turbo failure symptom\n",
       "2. The fact that it smokes worse when warm and when revved points to the turbo\n",
       "3. Clean spark plugs despite heavy smoking suggests the oil isn't entering through the combustion chamber\n",
       "4. The oil you found in the intake manifold is another strong indicator\n",
       "\n",
       "Even though you didn't see oil at the turbo exhaust connection, it doesn't mean the turbo isn't leaking. Oil can leak into the exhaust side and be completely burned off by the time it reaches where you checked. It only takes a small amount of oil past the turbine seals to create massive smoke.\n",
       "\n",
       "Several things to check:\n",
       "- Check for play in the turbo shaft/impeller\n",
       "- Inspect the intercooler for oil contamination\n",
       "- Look at the PCV system, particularly the check valve that prevents boost pressure from pushing oil into the intake\n",
       "- Verify the air filter housing isn't restricted (can create vacuum that pulls oil in)\n",
       "\n",
       "I'd recommend replacing the turbo before reassembling everything. This is a very common issue with these Saabs, and the symptoms match perfectly. The oil is likely leaking on the exhaust side and going straight to the hot catalytic converter, creating the massive smoke you're seeing.\n",

Does that open just the 2 front as well or all 4 doors? These units are common for failing. It could be a faulty switch there in the middle console, but unlikely if the 2 front are working. I would start by removing the central lock fuse and see what happens, everything should open manually. I would aslo remove the switch in the middle console, these are know for getting ruined from coke, water etc.\n\nThe lock signal out of the general module (body control unit) for the rear doors and gas door is pins number 13 (black roughly 12gage wire) and pin number 14 (blue,12gauge wire)Of the large connector on the general module. the signal toggles back and forth for lock and unlock.

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your symptoms with the rear door locks and gas door not operating, here are some troubleshooting steps to follow:\n\n1. First, check the fuses in the trunk near the battery. The fuel door actuator often blows a fuse when it fails, which can disable multiple central locking functions. When checking fuses, be careful as these blade-type fuses can sometimes crack rather than completely blow, giving false readings during testing.\n\n2. Try disconnecting the gas door actuator and recheck the system. Failed fuel door actuators are known to cause system issues.\n\n3. Perform a system reset by disconnecting the battery cables and touching them together through a 10 ohm, one watt resistor for a few minutes, then reconnect.\n\n4. If you need to test the General Module (body control unit) directly, the lock signals for the rear doors and gas door are on pins 13 (black wire, approx. 12 gauge) and 14 (blue wire, 12 gauge) of the large connector. These signals toggle between lock/unlock. The GM is located behind the glove box.\n\n5. Try removing the central lock fuse to see if doors will open manually.\n\n6. Check if unlocking through the trunk with the key affects just the front doors or all doors - this can help diagnose where the issue lies.\n\nIf communication with the Assenmacher retriever still fails after these steps and you can communicate with other systems, the General Module itself may be faulty.\n</ANSWER>"

Inspect the wiring harness more thoroughly for intermittent shorts or breaks\n\nIf all tests point to the solenoid, it's worth noting that one forum member successfully replaced just the solenoid on their 9-5 rather than the entire transmission. Interestingly, they found that the same solenoid is used in some Volvo transmissions and was available at half the price.\n\nRegarding your TCM question - yes, you can use a used TCM if needed, but make sure it's properly matched to your vehicle and may require programming.\n\nI'd recommend trying the solenoid replacement first before considering a TCM or full transmission replacement, as several members have had success with just replacing the solenoid.\n</ANSWER>"

Verify fuel pressure readings - what were the pressure numbers before changing the pump?\n\n3. Consider checking for exhaust restrictions:\n   - Remove upper O2 sensors to see if providing an exhaust path helps\n   - Check for plugged catalytic converters\n\n4. Since you have spark and fuel delivery but it won't run:\n   - Check for large vacuum leaks\n   - Verify EGR isn't stuck open\n   - Check MAF and camshaft position sensor readings\n   - Verify compression (fuel-fouled plugs could be washing down cylinders)\n\n5. Try disconnecting the MAF plug and throttle body connectors - the engine should run/idle (though without throttle response) to help diagnose.\n\nThe fact that it runs briefly on ether but fouls plugs with fuel strongly points to fuel quality issues or possibly a restricted exhaust system. I'd start with a fuel sample test.\n</ANSWER>"

         "if the heads were done correctly and there is a new waterpump and thermostat, all that is left is the radiator. is there coolant flow throughout the radiator? is there any \"stop leak\" in the radiator? is there airflow?\n\nHi Art,recheck for HC in cooling system if no good send it back to the dealer, if no HC detected this time, then concentrate in the radiator , for partially restricted one. This vehicle has already plenty of mileage.Good luck.\n\nart have you checked the clutch on the fan, have seen some wiyh this problemdan\n\nReplace the radiator.\n\nsounds like all you have left is a bad radiator, suggest have flow checked.\n\nWith that kind of mileage Art, I would have the Radiator tubes inspected or rodded out by a Radiator Shop. Could be that Radiator has 50% or more of the tubes plugged. Also check to see if there is any matting of materials in front of the radiator behind the condenser.\n\nArt... Just because the headgaskets where changed doesn't mean that there isn't a problem with either the cylinder head itself or the engine block. The machine shope that milled the deck should have partical inspected the heads for cracks. These cracks can be invisible to the naked eye, but will cause the same problem as a blown head gasket. The engine block could also have a crack in it, this would not show up under compression test or cylinger leakage. One other things that I would consider would be a bad intake mainfold gasket. I would find thid unlikely however because this would normally cause anti-freeze to leak into the crank case. Seth...fourtytozero@yahoo.comDo You Yahoo!?

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on the symptoms and repairs already done, it sounds like you're dealing with a cooling system restriction rather than a head gasket issue. Since you've already:\n- Replaced the water pump (twice, including OEM)\n- Replaced the thermostat (twice, including OEM)\n- Had the dealer replace head gaskets and deck the heads\n\nYour most likely culprits are:\n\n1. Restricted radiator - With 110K miles, the radiator tubes could be 50% or more plugged. Have the radiator flow checked or take it to a radiator shop to have the tubes inspected/rodded out.\n\n2. Fan clutch issues - Check if the fan clutch is engaging properly. A failing fan clutch won't provide adequate airflow at lower speeds.\n\n3. Possible blockage in the cooling system - Check for debris or matting of materials in front of the radiator behind the condenser.\n\n4. Potential cracked heads - Even though the heads were replaced, there could be cracks that weren't visible during machining. These can cause the same symptoms as a blown head gasket.\n\nI'd start with having the radiator flow checked since that's the most common cause of overheating after all the work you've done. Also check the temperature difference between the two radiator hoses when overheating - if they're significantly different, it confirms a restriction in the radiator or a defective thermostat.\n</ANSWER>"

         "I have this Lexus that came in with a blown timing belt and an overheat.The customer asked on the phone if we did that kind of work and although I try to stay away from full replacement we do head work all the time.Upon inspection the overheat was bad enough to crack the radiator.Talked the owner into a low mile (80000) motor.Normally would not do the job but she reminded me of her large towing expense and I did tell her on the phone we did \"engine\" work.We installed a new water pump/timing belt to be safe.Upon start up it had what sounded like a stuck lifter.The salvage yard requested that we drive it and see if it came out of it.After a week the noise is still there.Had the tech change the oil again with a Toyota filter and check valve clearance(these are not hydraulic lifters but a shimmed tappet.The noise seems be coming from the front of the right head though you hear it through the wheel well.Shorting out cylinders makes no change.Also checked for bent rods.I understand they had some wrist pin issues with this engine but it sounds too light in my opinion.Tried top engine cleaner and a borocope down the plug hole and came up empty. The salvage yard claims it was quiet when it left and would like a diagnosis before they decide what they want us to do.I will try to post an audio/video tomorrow but just looking for any common problems for now.Thanks in advance.",
         "sound like a bad lifter.\n\nChris, they don't have lifters. You could run it with the rocker cover off and see for anything obvious. Could it be a vvti problem? If this has it? Did the motor come with an intake? Could something be dropped down the intake port?\n\nI would check the cam shaft scissor gear for alignment, you should use a bolt to hold the alignment.Good luck Shawn\n\nHad a tech let one of these engines eat something ( don't know what ) but what ever it was knocked 1 valve keeper out of 2 different valve. believe it or not it didn't drop a valve. It was on the right side also. Good luck. Mark\n\nYou have t check the valve clearance cold. And did your tech find any shims not to spec? These things do make noise when the gap is to large and a proper shim may be all you need.\n\nI agree with Wayne from Florida. These are typically good motors and not an issue with a used one. However, it is not impossible that someone had messed with the engine prior to you receiving it. A simple test you can do to check if it is in the valves is to temporarily change the viscosity of the oil. This may change the noise and may help you get closer to finding the cause.\n\nThose cam gears have to be preloaded and a bolt placed into the gear to lock in place before installed. Once installed you can remove the bolt and it will be ok otherwise you get a noise. It could be that. Might be time to pull the pan and check the inside for bearing material. I had a Tundra that made a noise that sounded upper end and it had bearing material in the bottom of the pan when I pulled it. Toyota told me it's not uncommon to think it's coming from the upper end when it's bottom end one an all aluminum Toyota engine as the sound resonates. Just thinking top of my head here former Toyota dealer tech.\n\nTry to pinpoint which bank is the noise source. If it sound like a metallic ticking noise with the rhythm of a valve opening than you have to pull the cylinder head and reseat ( lap) the valves. Remove the camshaft and lifters and open and close the valves. See if the noise of closing the valve manually is the same. Other option is to red line the engine few times for several seconds. If something was trapped into the piston head may need to be seated. It is an easy friendly engine to work on. Unfortunately seems like you not getting paid for this. Good luck!",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, this sounds like a valve train issue in the right cylinder head. Since the 2007 GX470 doesn't use hydraulic lifters but shimmed tappets, here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Check valve clearances while cold - improper clearance can cause ticking noises that sound like lifter problems.\n\n2. Inspect the VVT-i system - this could be causing the noise if there's an issue with the cam gear.\n\n3. Examine the camshaft scissor gear alignment - these should be properly aligned with a bolt holding them during installation.\n\n4. Look for foreign objects - something may have been dropped down the intake port or gotten into the valve train.\n\n5. Check for damaged valve keepers - there have been cases where these engines had valve keeper issues without dropping valves.\n\n6. Pull the valve cover and run the engine briefly to visually inspect the valve train operation.\n\n7. Consider checking the oil pan for bearing material - sometimes what sounds like top-end noise in Toyota aluminum engines can actually be bottom-end related.\n\n8. Try changing oil viscosity temporarily as a diagnostic test - if the noise changes, it may help pinpoint the cause.\n\nSince the salvage yard claims it was quiet when it left, document your findings thoroughly before proceeding. Running the engine with the valve cover off would be my first diagnostic step to visually identify the source of the noise.\n</ANSWER>"

Even if they look good visually, tug on them with needle-nose pliers to verify integrity.\n\n2. Verify battery connections are clean and tight, and confirm you have 12V at the battery.\n\n3. Test the ignition switch - there should be two hot wires at the switch with key OFF. If only one is hot, check fusible links. If both are hot, you likely have a bad ignition switch.\n\n4. Check the power at the starter solenoid to see if it's feeding out to all circuits.\n\n5. Inspect ground connections - corrosion could be an issue since the vehicle was sitting.\n\n6. Look for any aftermarket installations (radio, remote start) that might have damaged wiring.\n\nIf you need to replace the ignition switch, avoid the NAPA brand - several techs report better results with AC Delco switch #D1498C.\n\nThese Blazers are known for wiring problems with chassis harness corrosion, particularly wires that feed the fuel pump.

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description of a recurring transmission fluid leak from the bellhousing on this 2000 Subaru Outback, there are several potential causes to investigate:\n\n1. Worn torque converter support bushing - This is a common issue that can cause misalignment of the converter with the seal, creating leaks even after replacing the seal. When the bushing wears, it doesn't hold the converter true in the seal.\n\n2. O-ring around the pump - Several techs mentioned this as a likely culprit. The O-ring may be hardened or damaged.\n\n3. Cracked torque converter - You can diagnose this by adding dye to the fluid and checking the leak pattern. A cracked converter will spray fluid around the diameter of the bellhousing, while a seal leak will show a straight trail down from the seal.\n\n4. Pipe seal behind the oil seal - There's a seal that wraps around the oil pump shaft separating the gear oil compartment of the front differential. This requires separating the bellhousing for access.\n\n5. Differential/transmission connection issue - Verify whether it's transmission fluid or differential fluid leaking. The differential needs to be removed from the trans to replace the front seal on the transmission.\n\nDiagnostic steps:\n- Add dye to the fluid and check the leak pattern after driving\n- Inspect the torque converter bushing for wear\n- Check the O-rings on the torque converter tube\n- Verify the fluid type (trans vs. differential)\n\nIf you're still having issues after checking these areas, you might consider a quality used transmission as a last resort.\n</ANSWER>"

I'm growing to hate modern automobiles and all these headaches. What a world ...\n\n2018 Terrain he park brake calibration procedure can be completed using the following steps:Block the drive wheels. Install a scan tool to the vehicle. Turn the ignition switch to the ON/RUN position with the engine OFF. Select Configuration/Reset Functions from the electronic brake control module menu. If available, perform the parking brake calibration procedure. If park brake calibration is not available, proceed back and select Control Functions. Perform the Rear Brake Caliper Piston Extend function.

I recommend you quit bankrupting yourself trying to be all things to all people.Many are learning a hard reality to only stick to one or maybe two brands these days, and even then limiting what models. We are in an age of specialization.Technology is moving so rapidly that even new models are having running production upgrades on a frequent basis.In 20 more years there will be practically nobody qualified to work on vehicles. Teams of engineers build these things but no one is educating the techs who are working on them. Many of the systems are not designed to be worked on. Vehicles are going just as any other electronics device, they are becoming an expendable commodity.Average laptop 3K... Average car 30K... life expectancy for each 3-5 years. Some, may be more, but many may be less.Sorry for the gray clouds, but quit beating your self up. I will not work on anything newer than a 2015.

This issue happened to two seperate 2019 equinoxs'. I tried reprogramming this last one, but it seems once you get to the point you are at, the only option to fix it is an EBCM and reprogram. I seperated the hydraulic unit and replaced the EBCM with a used unit and reprogrammed. I have not 100% figured this one out yet, but after this second time I am thinking that you need to complete service mode by doing parking brake calibration setting.",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your VIN, you're working on a 2019 GMC Terrain, not a 2017, which explains some of your issues. The electronic parking brake system on these newer models requires specific procedures.\n\nYour main problem appears to be that you didn't properly exit service mode after retracting the calipers. For electronic parking brakes on these vehicles, the correct procedure after pad replacement is:\n\n1. Block the drive wheels\n2. Use GDS2 (not Zeus or other aftermarket scanners) to access the EBCM\n3. After replacing pads and rotors, you need to perform the \"parking brake calibration\" procedure, not just the \"extend\" function\n\nSeveral techs have reported similar issues with 2018-2019 Equinox/Terrain models where using the wrong sequence or aftermarket scanners leads to the exact error you're experiencing (C0561 EEPROM error).\n\nAt this point, your options are:\n1. Try using GDS2 specifically to perform the parking brake calibration\n2. Disconnect the battery, touch cables together to reset, then try again with proper calibration\n3.

         "Need to know if this car has electronic throttle body system or not.(ETS/TCS) It is not the same routing. I should be able to fax you a diagram if I have this detail. Yuval Ultima Ltd. Motorworks E-Mail: TCS@ultimaltd.com781/894-0050\n\nDon't have the diagram here but as I remember that hose goes through the firewall to the left and below the brake master, and connects to the overpressure transducer and the turbo gauge on the dash.\n\nIf I remember right, I think from that tee a hose goes inside to the boost gauge.\n\nIt sounds like that is the hose that feeds the boost gauge. Does the boost gauge work? There is a vacuum fitting under the wiper linkage, wich is under the cowl cover, that is a little hard to find. It is a white plastic nipple on the firewall just left of the heater box. Hope this helps. Jeff\n\nI'm prety sure it goes through the false bulk head (the firewall) between the heater hoses.

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, it sounds like you're dealing with a vacuum line routing issue on your 1995 Saab 9000 CSE Turbo. The mystery line with the tee connection is most likely the boost gauge line.\n\nThe routing should be:\n1. One end connects to the intake\n2. Then runs to the air bypass valve for the turbo on the air inlet ducting\n3. There's a tee in the line\n4. The third end (the one you can't locate) most likely goes through the firewall to connect to the boost gauge on your dashboard\n\nLook for a white plastic nipple on the firewall just to the left of the heater box, under the wiper linkage and cowl cover. This connection point can be difficult to find. The line passes through the firewall in the area between the heater hoses.\n\nIf your boost gauge isn't working, this is likely your issue. The vacuum line feeds pressure data to the gauge and possibly to an overpressure transducer.\n\nIf you need a visual reference, the Saab parts catalog has diagrams that show this routing clearly. The routing may also vary depending on whether your car has the Electronic Throttle System/Traction Control System (ETS/TCS).\n</ANSWER>"

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on the information provided, it sounds like the sensor you're describing in the front right top of the engine behind the timing cover could be one of these:\n\n1. A turbo oil feed line connection point - this is what appears most likely according to Tech 2 information. On C/K trucks, this location is typically used for oil feed to the turbocharger, though it may be different on vans.\n\n2. Possibly a low oil pressure shutdown switch - you could test this by unplugging it or grounding it to see if it causes the engine to shut down.\n\n3. It could be for some aftermarket equipment, possibly an oil temperature sensor that was added later.\n\nSince two GM dealers, Alldata, and Mitchell haven't been able to identify it, you might try:\n- Taking pictures of the part and having the dealership match it to diagrams in their parts book\n- Checking if any aftermarket equipment was installed on the vehicle\n- Tracing the wire to see where it leads in the harness\n\nWhatever it is, if it's leaking oil, you'll need to replace it or plug the hole if it's not needed. The fact that disconnecting it doesn't affect any gauges or warning lights suggests it might be for a system that's no longer in use or was optional equipment.\n</ANSWER>"

Conditions: M.I.L. On, No Codes",
         "Hello SAAB Techs - This 900 Turbo is giving us M.I.L.s but no codes are being stored. Intermittently, the \"Check Gearbox\" light comes on, followed by the \"Check Engine\" light. Both lights will stay on for a few seconds and then go off until the next time. Sometimes this will happen every few minutes of driving. My Tech 2 doesn't see any codes, even when the light is on. The transmission doesn't go into limp-home so far as I can tell - it upshifts normally in the forward gears BUT it thumps badly into reverse when the light is on. Wait a few seconds until the light is out and it gets reverse gear normally. Otherwise the car runs fine. Another possible piece of the puzzle - two weeks ago this customer reported an intermittent A.B.S. warning light, but again, the Tech 2 returned no codes. I haven't done as much testing as I (and iATN) would have liked because my schedule is seriously jammed. I have made the customer an appointment for next Monday (Aug 9) which is the soonest I can take a serious look at it, so I have a week to think about it and consult with iATN colleagues. We're a SAAB shop so I have a collection of ECMs, MIUs and what-all. I am thinking transmission control module or perhaps ignition switch. As always, i'd be very grateful if anybody has seen this before and wants to share their understanding. One way or another, you should hear from me again in about a week. Thanks in advance -",
         "Hi BartI don't have a fix for it but can brain storm a little.Usually when no codes are logged it is because the power or ground to the ECU was interrupted (just like disconnecting the battery for awhile). So I wonder if it could be a bad battery cable or dirty battery posts or a ground connection that is failing?Ignition switch is also a suspected part and since both the 97 and 98 900 was still equipped with the \"old\" style switch. I would rip the shifter box out and check the part number. If it has the old part number (4409553) I would throw a new one in there just for the hell of it (4946307).Good luckSWEDECAR Anders Johannesson 22634 Normandie Ave, Unit A Torrance, CA 90502 USA www.swedecar.com anders@swedecar.com Work 310-328-1731 Fax 310-328-0421\n\nsounds like the ignition switch is failing,I had one with the same symptoms,I noticed the voltage reading on tech2 under read values/activate of abs was varying up and down a lot maybe 10 volts,also then noticed the instrument lights doing strange things,ignition switch fixed em all. hth jerto\n\nHave you looked in Generic OBDII to see if there are any codes, have had this type of problem before and code only listed in Generic.",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your symptoms with the 1997 Saab 900 SE Turbo, this sounds like a classic ignition switch failure. Here's what I'd recommend:\n\n1. Check the ignition switch - The 97-98 900s have the \"old\" style switch (part #4409553) which is a common failure point. When these fail, they can cause intermittent power interruptions to various control modules, explaining why you're getting warning lights but no stored codes. If it has the old part number, replacing it with the newer version (4946307) might solve your issues.\n\n2. Check power/ground connections - When no codes are logged despite warning lights, it's often because power or ground to the ECU was interrupted. Inspect battery cables, posts, and ground connections for corrosion or looseness.\n\n3. Check voltage readings - Try monitoring voltage readings on the Tech 2 under read values/activate of the ABS system. If you see fluctuating voltage (around 10V), this further points to the ignition switch.\n\n4. Try Generic OBDII mode - Sometimes codes only show up in Generic OBDII mode rather than the Saab-specific diagnostics.\n\nThe fact that you're seeing both transmission and ABS warning lights with no stored codes strongly suggests an electrical supply issue rather than actual component failures. The \"thumping\" into reverse when the light is on is likely the transmission responding to the voltage fluctuation.\n</ANSWER>"

         "If left parked this vehicle would have a dead battery within three days. This has been happening since the vehicle was new. It was at the dealership several times without being resolved. It has been at independent shops without being resolved. It has an aftermarket remote start as well as an aftermarket ceiling mounted DVD player w/ dome lights. After hooking up my equipment I started with the basics of pulling fuses. I found my draw would go away if I removed power to the main cable from the under hood junction box to the under dash junction box. I removed all the fuses and relays in the junction box under the dash and still had a draw. I removed all the main power cables to the junction box and still had a draw. I traced the cable back and found the command start was tied into that wire. I found two relays that were part of the starter and one was powered up and engaged at all times. I unhooked power to the relay and the draw went away. It was 19mA. I reassembled all components and retested for a draw. It was back, 230mA. I removed the command start completely and all the related wiring harnesses. I returned it to stock. No damaged or shorted wires were found. During this I found the DVD player was wired into the command start wiring. I removed it as well. The draw a was gone. Again I reassembled and the draw came back. Now I had the draw even when I unhooked the cable at the under hood junction box. I disassembled and broke down the junction box. I found I had a draw for the front blower motor and rear blower motor controller. When I unhooked the motor and controller my draw went away. I removed the control wire from the front blower motor and plugged it back in. The draw was gone for about 10 seconds and returned. I unhooked the blower motor and the draw was gone. The same thing in the rear. I left them unhooked and the draw came back. Plugging them back in didn't change the draw. I now had my draw from the short bar to the four fuses that are after it. The Radio 1, CRT, ECU B, and Dome. If I unplugged all the fuses my draw was gone, but if I plugged any one fuse in the draw came back. I decided since the draw was moving I may have a grounding issue. Prior to this I unplugged the NAV (radio) unit and the dome lights, etc. I still had a draw if I plugged one of the fuses in. I also monitored it over night to make sure I wasn't just not waiting long enough. We have had the vehicle in the shop for over a week now. I removed all the grounds and cleaned, dielectric greased and tightened them. There are a lot of grounds. I have this truck completely apart. After all this I still have a 230mA draw.",
         "I have seen this much draw on Cadillacs of years past and was considered normal?? Could this be \"normal draw? Anyone have a spec or vehicle to compare to?\n\nMax current draw any car should be no higher than about 100ma. Ck your basics, charging system, glove box light ect., than see if 1 of your computers is always on, or the alarm system\n\nhave seen the radio unit it self be a low < 300 ma draw\n\nShould have no more then 50ma draw, this is after disconnecting the neg battery terminal, connecting the amp meter and allowing it 20minutes. You can use a jumper wire between the neg post and batt terminal for a few minutes to be sure all the ecu's are in sleep mode.\n\nHi Graham, Do all the accessories work properly.? I had a Sequoia that had a draw, something in the rear gate{either the window or wiper} was inoperative but was keeping the BCM powered up because it was not parked properly. Check that all you factory stuff works properly.\n\nOn this late of a model, there is very little draw allowable, usually less than 20mA after all modules shutdown. The 50mA figure is old school spec, and does not apply here. Sounds as though you have a module not shutting down.\n\nLook up the voltage drop across fuse chart. If you don't have it I can email you it. Then use your voltage meter to single out exactly which fuse has the current draw. Seems like you keep waking something up while testing. I have seen bluetooth modules wake up when getting a signal from a phone.If you never have tried it, it is the best way to locate a draw on vehicles without disturbing the modules by circuit interruption. Copy and paste: http://www.search...sting-parasitic-draw",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your detailed troubleshooting, you're dealing with a significant parasitic draw of 230mA, which is definitely excessive for your 2008 Toyota Highlander. For reference, normal parasitic draw should be no more than 20-50mA on a modern vehicle like yours after all modules have gone to sleep (typically 20 minutes after shutdown).\n\nA few suggestions:\n\n1. Use the voltage drop across fuse method instead of disconnecting components. This prevents waking up modules during testing, which seems to be happening in your case. You can measure the voltage drop across each fuse with a digital multimeter without removing them.\n\n2. Allow the vehicle to fully \"go to sleep\" before testing (20+ minutes with a jumper wire between negative post and battery terminal, then remove jumper and connect ammeter).\n\n3. Since you've already eliminated the aftermarket remote start and DVD player, focus on factory systems:\n   - Check if all factory accessories work properly\n   - Look for a module that's not shutting down properly\n   - Verify the BCM isn't being kept awake by a component that's not \"parked\" in its proper position\n\n4. Check for Bluetooth modules or other wireless systems that might be waking up during testing.\n\nThe fact that your draw \"moves\" between circuits suggests either a grounding issue (which you've addressed) or a module that's not properly going to sleep and is drawing power through different circuits.\n</ANSWER>"

         "Hi. This duramax had a tuner (bullydog) and is overfueling off idle, knocking at idle sometimes and misses on number 7 at idle.. I recently repaired two injector connectors that were a little burnt on cyl 2 and 6. now it runs better at idle. Cylinder #1 has a fuel knock that dissappears when it is disabled. A new injector did not solve that problem.. the sound actually is coming from the other side of the motor (weird). off idle the injection sounds like the pressure is spiked and it dumps out black smoke. If I disable cyl #5 the smoke disappears. An injector installed in that cyl 5 did not solve that problem. I feel there is a FICM problem but can't find info on testing output and control to injectors. Need some guidance. Anybody had a burned out FICM?",
         "Maybe the tuning in the car makes these problem happens, I think it is better to remove the tuning and test the car again.\n\nHi Tim.Your balance rates indicate Cylinder 7 is running lean and tryng to correct it.The connectors for 2 and 7 are a known problem depending on which 6.6.VIN 1 or 2.There is a revised connector and bracket kit.TSB 05-06-04-047c.This will normally set codes.When this occurrs it will run bad and fuel knock.Eliminate the aftermarket module first.Sometimes they will cause engine damage and or communications problems.I have seen a lot of burned up pistons from them.That is why it will void the engine warranty.Check #5 injector seals and sleeve for leaks.Good luck.\n\nDisconnect the tuner and make sure it's not a software issue in the tuner. Have had a few that were throwing false codes and running bad because of the tuner glitching\n\nGet rid of the chip first off, go from there. The makers of these things don't care how it affects the vehicle, as long as they have your money. I also don't believe there is enough testing done.\n\nHere is a link to a post in the forum section Tim. If it does not work just search [white smoke diagnostics] in the theory section. I use this method to locate the bad injectors, the one coment on the end is about min ms on time at idle. This does work, before it seemed unless i replaced all injectors we were sort of were just chasing our tail around. Give it a read. http://members.ia...=4&f=forum12&m=64765\n\nI don't know a lot about diesels because I always hated working on them. But I do know that the Duramax's had big problems with cracked injectors. May need to replace all of them.\n\nI hate to ask a stupid question but have you verified fuel quality? Bio diesel or gas will cause injector imbalances & knocking. Also for the smoking, make sure the MAF sensor is very clean and it doesn't have a K&N type air filter as it throws MAF sensor readings way off. and positive seven is as high as I think the FICM will bump the injector, so that one either isn't flowing or it's using that cylinder to try to balance out an adjacent firing cylinder.\n\nThe injector connector kit is for the vin 2 LLY engine and will shut down 4 injectors at a time when it trips fault. A cracked injector will smoke white at idle as it leaks during all strokes and blows raw fuel out exhaust. Your black smoke is either from combustion over fueling due to a skewed sensor of a lack of air from filter or turbo pressure.",
         "<ANSWER>\nFirst, I'd strongly recommend removing the Bullydog tuner completely. Many of your symptoms could be related to the tuning, and aftermarket modules are known to cause engine damage and communication problems. I've seen burned pistons from these devices, which is why they void warranties.\n\nFor your specific issues:\n\n1. The balance rates indicate cylinder #7 is running lean and trying to compensate. The connectors for cylinders #2 and #7 are a known problem on the LLY Duramax. There's a revised connector and bracket kit (TSB 05-06-04-047c) that addresses this.\n\n2. For cylinder #5 causing black smoke: Check the injector seals and sleeve for leaks. The black smoke off idle suggests either combustion over-fueling due to a skewed sensor or lack of air from a clogged filter or turbo pressure issue.\n\n3. For the fuel knock in cylinder #1: Since replacing the injector didn't help and the sound comes from the opposite side, this could be related to the overall fuel system or tuning.\n\nAdditional checks:\n- Verify fuel quality (bio diesel or gas contamination can cause injector imbalances and knocking)\n- Clean the MAF sensor thoroughly\n- If you have a K&N type air filter, it might be throwing off MAF readings\n- Check for cracked injectors (a common Duramax issue)\n\nFor diagnosing injectors, search for \"white smoke diagnostics\" in the theory section of the forum for a good method to locate bad injectors.\n\nThe FICM will bump an injector up to positive seven at most, so cylinder #7 either isn't flowing properly or it's being used to balance out an adjacent cylinder.\n</ANSWER>"

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, there are several issues to consider with your 2008 Land Rover LR2 overheating problem:\n\n1. Fan Module: Yes, these modules are known to fail on LR2s. The module is controlled digitally by the PCM, and typically you need to purchase the complete fan assembly. Check alternative sources like atlanticbritish.com or roversnorth.com instead of the dealer for potentially better pricing.\n\n2. Temperature Control: The fan should be running at 100% by 221°F, with the PCM controlling fan speed via PWM. If it's reaching 228°F without fan activation, the module is likely bad as you suspect.\n\n3. Deeper Issues: The bubbling from the reservoir at 228°F suggests additional problems:\n   - Check the radiator cap pressure (often overlooked)\n   - Verify the water pump is functioning correctly\n   - Test for head gasket failure or engine damage (the quick overheating is concerning)\n   - Look for coolant in cylinders or air bubbles in coolant\n\n4. Diagnostic Approach:\n   - Use a capable scan tool to check coolant temp sensors\n   - Check the 5V NTC coolant sensor on the end of the block\n   - Perform a leak down test\n   - Pressurize the cooling system overnight to check for leaks\n\nThe purple wire likely carries the control signal from the PCM to the fan module.

Not necessarily Mazda but I'm sure its possible. Scott\n\nHi John, those aftermaket cats can be junk. I gave up on bosal and walker. there is a company called DEC that seems to be pretty good, of course the best bet is always original equipment dealer items. Good luck\n\nNo aftermarket convertor will satisfy the cat. monitor criteria on this vehicle. Factory cat, and good fuel trims, fixed for good.\n\nMy guess would be the aftermarket cat converter. Usually at the dealership when we repaleaced the cat then they never came back.\n\nDon't forget to check for exhaust leaks before the first sensor. They can screw up the b1s1 reading and make the car think the cat is bad!\n\nJohn, I also agree that the aftermarket cat is probably the problem. I have expeienced this with subaru's before. Good luck, Matt\n\nhi, i have gone through this with aftermarket converters on hondas and subarus. they just don't work for california emmissions cars. good luck\n\nWe have been through the same thing several times--works for a few weeks then same code. Aftermarket converter was the problem. After the new convertor from Subaru was installed problem went away. We didn't learn on the first one, so we have been there a couple of times. Some folks don't care and want to save the money but that's where it's at!\n\nAll we work on is Japanese cars. We do a LOT of Subi cats.. Dealer only! You get the Y pipe and both cats. Make sure you put the heat shields on the new cats.\n\nI would make sure they sold you a 3 way cat not a two way cat. I then would pull the front and rear sensors and \"sniff\" the gas through the wholes with a gas analyser and see if the cat is cleaning up at least 80% of the emissions. If not I think after two cats it would be fair enough to ask for a refund. Then buy a dealer cat and explain to the customer that you tried to save them money but its not going to happen and ask them to pay the difference. This situation is not your fault and should not cost YOU! Good luck.\n\nreplace aftermarket cat with OE only subaru's dont like aftermarket cats, also check headpipe, if its the double wall may have a internal leak and may need headpipe",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on the responses from multiple technicians, your issue is almost certainly the aftermarket catalytic converter. Subarus (like Hondas and Toyotas) are notoriously picky about aftermarket catalytic converters, and many technicians have experienced the same recurring P0420 code with Bosal and Walker brands specifically.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n1. Replace the aftermarket Bosal converter with an OEM Subaru catalytic converter. This is the most consistent solution mentioned by multiple technicians who've faced this exact issue.\n\n2. When installing the OEM converter, make sure to:\n   - Install all heat shields properly\n   - Check the head pipe for internal leaks (especially if it's a double-wall design)\n   - Verify there are no exhaust leaks before the first O2 sensor\n\n3. If you're hesitant about the cost of an OEM converter, some techs have had better luck with DEC brand aftermarket converters than Bosal or Walker, but OEM is still the most reliable solution.\n\nYour fuel trims look good, and since there's no oil or antifreeze consumption, this really points to the aftermarket converter being the culprit. This is a known issue with Subarus - they simply don't play well with many aftermarket catalytic converters when it comes to passing the catalyst monitor criteria.\n</ANSWER>"

         "Hello everyone and help with this darling. This one is in for a code 26 and 27 stored in the PCM. If you have it idling, it won't set a the light on..but you drive it about 3 blocks and on the light comes. This is consistent..no more than 2.5 to 3 blocks and the light is on. I have checked for voltage at the purge and EGR solenoids..as well as ohmed them at around 40 ohms each. That seems OK. The SES light and hot light work fine. The radiator fan works as well as the speedo. The AC comp does engage. They say there should be an upshift light, but I certainly don't see one. The component that does not seem to work is the motorized seatbelt system. I found the larger of the 3 connectors disconnected and the belts in the B pillar position. The cusotmer said they bound up and I suspect that someone disconnected them in the rear position. I rehooked them up and the belt \"wants\" to work but is bound up. I hear the seatbelt module click sometimes when i am accelerating on the rack. I am at a bit of a loss here as to if I should pursue the seatbelt module or if i am missing something. And what is with this upshift light that is supposed to be there but does not seem to be. ThanksRon",
         "Ronald, neither seal belt or shift light system will effect the map sensor. If you have scan data and a vacuum pump you can test the performance of the map sensor. Also if you look where the map sensor vacuum line hooks up at the t-body you will see that the vacuum port is part of a housing that attaches to the t-body with some fasteners. You may have to take the t-body off the intake but remove the fasteners and take the housing off. The gasket between the housing and the t-body fails and causes a vacuum leak and an incorrect map output.....Rosco\n\nHi Ronald, Code 26 will set if the upshift light is burnt out. It is an amber bulb located in the lower right of the instrument cluster. I remember this because I've worked on a Saturn where the PCM was replaced for a Code 26 (QDM fault) and the MIL still came back. It was the upshift bulb all along.\n\nDitto on the upshift lamp bulb, it and the EGR & EVAP solenoids are ground controlled through the ECM. The quad driver codes will set if the circuits open/short or resistance gets too high. The ECM will shut down control of the circuit for internal damage protection. The upshift lamp must be functioning. The EGR & EVP solenoids are very common issues on these cars after 90,000 miles or so. Replace them if the upshift lamp bulb does not completely cure the problem. HTH! Matt\n\nchances are that upshift light is your culprit. quad driver turns it on, if the bulb is burned out the cel will come on. i am assuming this car has a manual trans.",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your codes 26 and 27 (Quad Driver Module faults), here's what you need to check:\n\nFirst, focus on the upshift light - it's an amber bulb located in the lower right of the instrument cluster. Code 26 will specifically set if this upshift light is burnt out. This is very likely your primary issue since you mentioned not seeing it.\n\nThe EGR and EVAP solenoids check out at 40 ohms which is good, but these components commonly fail on Saturns after 90,000 miles (you're at 119k). They're ground-controlled through the ECM, and if their circuits open/short or resistance gets too high, the quad driver codes will set.\n\nTroubleshooting steps:\n1. Replace the upshift indicator bulb first - this is the most likely cause based on your symptoms\n2. If that doesn't resolve it, replace the EGR and EVAP solenoids\n3. If you have scan data and a vacuum pump, test the MAP sensor performance\n4. Check for vacuum leaks at the throttle body where the MAP sensor vacuum line connects\n\nThe seatbelt system issues are separate and won't affect the MIL lamp or these specific codes.\n</ANSWER>"

This 2003 Cadillac Escalade is a 6.0L / 8 cyl / Gas engine with 4-speed Automatic Transmission (Electronic) transmission.\nDelivery system: Fuel Injection Affected component: Master Cyl, Hydroboost Conditions: Brake Lock",
         "I have this 03 Escalade EXT Truck with hydro-boost brake assist that came to us from another shop with intermittent brake lock after hard(emergency) stop. It will lock all the brakes and it won 19t let go till I crack open a brake line bleeder or brake fitting at the master cylinder. It will release the brakes also, if we loosen the two nuts that hold the master cylinder to the hydro boost (about 1-2 turns on the nuts) Later discovered that slight tap on the brake pedal releases the pressure in the brake system and wheels will go free again. Symptom appeared after leaky master cylinder replacement. Since than another MC was tried, new calipers and flexible brake hoses all around, used hydro-boost. At that point we inherited the truck from the first shop. Flushed the PS fluid, tried third and fourth master cylinder, one new one used, brakes still lock-up after short drive and hard push on the brake pedal. Filed down the push rod about 1/16 inch, verified the washer and spring are installed correctly. Brake fluid looks clear after 3 master cylinder swaps. Still brake lock every other time you step hard on brake pedal at about 10 mph.",
         "Have you pulled up on the brake peddle to see if they release?\n\nIt does sound like the rod is too long, when you crack open the bolts between mc and booster, fluid returns properly. Try putting washers between mc and booster temporarily, if it doesn't lock up, there is a problem with the pushrod, maybe not seating correctly.\n\nMy guess would be the power steering pump is bad.\n\nobviously something is causing the brake booster push rod to push forward on the master cylinder. You can remove the master cylinder and see if the push rod moves when you start the truck. Binding brake pedal?, Binding brake switch? Incorrectly adjusted brake switch? Bad used brake booster or wrong one?\n\nA defective or incorrect hydo-boost or incorrect push rod length will cause the pedal lock up. If brake pedal is not binding on its pivot I would replace the h-b with a new GM hydro-boost or with one that included the push rod as per the application.\n\nThe hydro-booster is not returning to a full rest position or there is some mechanical interference which prevents full release.\n\nWeng, If problem started after master cyl replacement and pressure releases with bolts loosend at hydroboost,sounds like one of those would be the problem.If pressure releases with a tap on the brake pedal possibly something binding not allowing full return?Would be nice to have old parts to compare.If problem started with master would look closely at that.\n\nYes pull up the pedal when locked but make sure if it goes up some the relay rod to the booster follows. Make sure nothing is blocking the pedal return like a trailer brake system, line lock, jerk wiring or repair job or whatever. Is it possible the HB unit is staying applied because it can't bleed off the apply pressure due to a restricted hose or something?\n\nI think that you will find that the brake pedal pivot is binding/sticking, if you are able to make the brakes release with a pull up of the pedal after your moderate to hard stop.Good Luck\n\nCheck for binding in the brake pedal if you do not find any replace the booster with a new or rebuilt one.\n\nAfter realizing the brakes released when you unbolted the master cylinder from the booster, why did you try 2 more master cylinders? I would suggest you gain an understanding of basic hydraulics or sublet the job to a shop who has this understanding.",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, it sounds like the issue is with the interaction between the master cylinder and the hydro-boost unit. Since the brakes release when you loosen the MC-to-booster bolts or tap the brake pedal, this points to a pressure release problem.\n\nSeveral possibilities to check:\n\n1. Push rod length/adjustment: Since filing down the push rod didn't solve it, try temporarily placing washers between the master cylinder and booster to increase the gap. If this stops the lock-up, you've confirmed it's a push rod issue.\n\n2. Brake pedal assembly: Check for binding in the brake pedal pivot or mechanism. Try pulling up on the brake pedal when locked to see if it releases and if the relay rod follows properly.\n\n3. Hydro-boost issues: The hydro-boost may not be returning to full rest position. Since the problem started after the original master cylinder replacement and has persisted through multiple MC replacements, the hydro-boost is highly suspect.\n\n4. Power steering system: Verify the power steering pump is functioning correctly as it supplies pressure to the hydro-boost.\n\n5. Brake switch: Check for incorrect adjustment or binding of the brake switch.\n\nI'd recommend replacing the hydro-boost with a new GM unit that includes the correct push rod for your application. Using rebuilt or used units may be contributing to the problem if they're not exactly right for your vehicle.\n</ANSWER>"

         "This vehicle came in missing on #1 and #3 cylinders with the check engine light on. Also had code for cam timing. Idles extremely rough but seems to run ok?? off idle but power is not as good as normal. We have compression tested the engine and all cylinders are 125 psi. The spark plugs had already been changed by the customer on the 2 missing cylinders but had installed the wrong plugs. Replaced all plugs and moved coils from one side of engine to the other and misfire stayed same. Checked camshaft timing and it is perfect. Injectors flow tested fine. I actually figured this one out yesterday but wanted to get the symptoms on here so you guys would have this fix. I'll post the fix in a little while.",

Live data did show right cam at 48 degrees advance, left was 2 degrees.With key on you could dis-connect soleniod wire at good side an a loud click could be heard when wire was refitted, right side was quieter.",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your symptoms of misfires on cylinders #1 and #3, rough idle, and cam timing code, this could be related to the AVCS (Active Valve Control System) on your Subaru Forester XT.\n\nIn a similar case, we found that the issue was with the oil feed pipe to the AVCS solenoid. The strainer in the oil feed pipe was broken, which affected the variable valve timing system. This would explain why your camshaft timing appeared correct when checked manually, but the engine was still experiencing misfires.\n\nI'd recommend:\n1. Remove and inspect the oil feed pipe to the AVCS solenoid\n2. Check for a broken strainer\n3. Clean the solenoid valve (you can do this without removing the rocker cover)\n\nWhen functioning properly, you should hear a distinct click when connecting/disconnecting the solenoid wire with the key on. In the problematic case, this click was noticeably quieter.\n\nThis would explain why the engine runs somewhat better off idle - the AVCS system has less effect at higher RPMs than at idle. The cam timing code also aligns with this diagnosis.\n</ANSWER>"

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, this sounds like an intermittent electrical issue that's causing the car to suddenly die. Since it only happens when the customer drives it but not during your test drives, here are the most likely culprits:\n\n1. Crankshaft position sensor - This is mentioned by multiple techs as a common cause. These can test good but still fail intermittently. Check resistance between pins 2 and 3 (should be around 900 ohms).\n\n2. Ignition switch - This could explain why it happens with the customer but not you. Check if she has a heavy keyring which might stress the switch. Try wiggling the key while idling to see if it affects operation.\n\n3. Fuel pump relay - This powers the injectors and can cause symptoms that mimic the ignition being turned off intermittently.\n\n4. Main relay (the one with \"109\" control code)\n\n5. Dirty throttle body - Since the car is driven gently, carbon buildup could be an issue. Clean the throttle body and perform a readaptation procedure afterward.\n\n6. Check all electrical connectors for corrosion, especially at the ECM and crank sensor.\n\n7. Inspect all vacuum hoses for leaks or splits.\n\nSince you mentioned the tachometer drops to 0 and all gauges die when it stalls, this strongly points to an electrical issue rather than a fuel delivery problem (which makes sense since your fuel pressure tests showed no changes).\n\nI'd start with the crank sensor and ignition switch as these are the most commonly reported fixes for this exact symptom on these cars.\n</ANSWER>"

Check your turbo intake hoses and connections - the most likely culprit is a cracked or disconnected turbo hose that's leaking under boost. The subframe work could have disturbed these connections.\n\n2. Verify the Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor is functioning properly:\n   - Try unplugging it to see if running behavior changes\n   - Use an OBD scanner to monitor MAF readings (should be 12-14 gps at idle, increasing with RPM)\n   - Check fuel trim numbers for indications of a lean condition\n\n3. Your fuel pressure (60 psi) is close to spec (58 psi/4 bar), so that's likely not the issue, but check fuel pump volume at the rail under load - should be about 1/2 liter in 30 seconds.\n\n4. Inspect the catalytic converter for blockage - remove O2 sensor and test back pressure.\n\n5. Check anything else that might have been disturbed during the subframe work, particularly the mass air tube.\n\nThis is likely not directly caused by your repair work - something was probably ready to fail and the timing coincided with your maintenance.\n</ANSWER>"

If it's not then the monitors won't run\n\nJust a thought here, many of the monitors require oxygen sensor input to verify their function, ie, air injection kicks on and looks for a drop in the O2 sensor voltage to confirm it is working. This is the case for evap and others. Misfire monitor does not use this however, but looks at the cassette and crankshaft sensor. If you have no monitors running I would take a hard look at the o2 sensor. Also check your thermostat to make sure it's reaching operating temperature. Brainstorming is all.

Check that the engine is reaching full operating temperature - this is critical for monitors to run. A faulty thermostat is very likely the culprit here, as several experienced techs have identified this as a common cause for this exact problem.\n\n2. Inspect the oxygen sensor functionality. Many monitors require proper O2 sensor input to verify their function (like air injection, EVAP, etc.). A failing O2 sensor could prevent multiple monitors from setting.\n\n3. Consider replacing:\n   - Thermostat (highest priority recommendation)\n   - Temperature sensor (if you want to be thorough)\n\n4. Verify the vehicle information is being entered correctly in the emissions testing equipment. Sometimes exemptions exist for certain vehicles/model years regarding monitor readiness, and incorrect data entry could cause unnecessary failures.\n\nThis appears to be a common issue with 1996-1997 Saab 900s with the 2.3L engine, but typically they eventually set monitors even if slowly.

Now do you have cap and rotor?, have you checked for compression stroke and see if rotor is headed for number one when at TDC on compression stroke. I would do that. Watch and make sure it rotates as well. If you have everything you say, you should see something wrong here. If not get back to us. If spark is at TDC then try a little gas into bore and see.

Do not reproduce/redistribute this email. This email was sent in strict accordance with our membership agreement and terms of service.\n\nYou said the cam and crank where 180, this is OK, as most gears aren't correct for this. 180 is ok because at one ,180 you have compression, the next exhaust. I always crank the engine for compression stroke TDC before installing distributer, or a check for proper rotor location. If timing was off, you would not have compression.What you say doesn't add up. The thing is, someone reading this isn't going to learn from what you listed, because until you moved distributer everything else was right. So what was done, you don't say you did a chain. So why was distributer out? Your facts aren't right. If you or customer did chainOK, but the distributer was never indexed to it. That is why it didn't start, not that the 180 dots.\n\nI agree with Harold.....there is another (recent) post where the guy (tried) to pass off the SAME stuff on us....Dan H.\n\nIt (also) was a Jeep 4.0...but a '99....and it was Jon from Ill. who said the crank and cam was 180* out....yeah,RIGHT.......Dan H.\n\nFirst of all,150 lb,s across the board tells you the engine is mechanicly good.Cam timing \"WAS\"correct,remember the drive ratio is two to one.When the crank is on tdc compression stroke,the two gears are dot to dot,but as the crank makes one more round to tdc again,it is now at top of exhaust and the cam has only turned half a revolution,which is where you found it. One more turn of the crank brings the two dots back together.Remember it takes two complete revolutions of the crank to complete on full cycle. I dont know what your problem was without seeing more,but it wasn,t cam timing if the crank dot was at 12 oclock and the cam was also at 12 oclock.Every other revolution will repeat this!! This is four stroke principle 101\n\nHi Chris.. all cams turn at 1/2 crank speed, so every other revolution the cam gear will appear 180 degrees out.. Turn the crank 1 full turn & check your marks again.. When you are trying to index the dist. wad up a paper towel in the # 1 plug hole & Bump the starter, when the paper blows out then turn the crank the rest of the way to TDC by hand & Dist. is ready to be installed.. align the rotor button to where it should be & make sure the fireing pickup parts are aligned & Should be close enough to fire right up.. Hope this Helps for Next time ;>? K.P.\n\nHi Chris.. clicked \" Refresh \" & then saw Keith's Message.. I have seen some pontiac V-8's that have had the marks 180 out & been ON the compression stroke.. So I Learned a Long time ago Not to trust the cam gear marks for dist placement... SHTH ;>? K.P.\n\nThe only question that remains is whether the spark is strong enough.Good luck.\n\nHi Chris, When @ tdc you should have dot to dot. But to verify bring crank to tdc. Cam dot will be in time(dot to dot)and distributor rotor at #1 on cap. OR crank at tdc and cam 180 out(like you wrote) AND distributor rotor 180 out. I believe it is in time. You should check injector pulse and fuel quality/contamination. Good Luck, Dennis Durand Swansea,Ma.",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, it sounds like you're concerned about the timing marks being 180 degrees out when the crank is at TDC. This is actually normal for a 4-stroke engine - the cam turns at half the speed of the crankshaft, so every other revolution will show the cam mark 180 degrees out.\n\nSince you've verified:\n- Good compression (150 psi across all cylinders)\n- Spark is present\n- Fuel is within specs (32-39 psi)\n- Timing appears correct\n\nHere are some things to check:\n\n1. Verify you're on the compression stroke for cylinder #1 when checking timing. You can put a paper towel in the #1 plug hole and bump the starter - when it blows out, you're approaching compression TDC.\n\n2. Check that the distributor is properly indexed. The rotor should be pointing to #1 when the engine is at TDC compression stroke. Some Jeep models had timing changes between years, so the distributor timing might need adjustment.\n\n3. Verify you have adequate injector pulse - you have fuel pressure, but are the injectors actually firing?\n\n4. Check fuel quality and look for contamination.\n\n5. Test the spark strength - you have spark, but is it strong enough?\n\nThe fact that your compression is good (150 psi) indicates the mechanical timing is likely correct. If timing was significantly off, you wouldn't have good compression readings.\n</ANSWER>"

         "The radio is no good, it would cost more to repair radio than it is worth. Recomend after market radio, or stock radio from a junk yard.\n\nHi Eric, There is an eject gear set that goes bad very commonly; I'm just not sure on the code 10 for you. Might have code info in owher's book. Eject & input of cassettes is the only thing affected by the gears when the problem occurs, but it's usually a stuck cassette. Unfixable if the tape's been pried out. If not, any competent repair shop probably can repair if it is the customer's favorite. I repair these with the upgraded stronger '98 model gears fairly frequently, and not costly compared even to a quality aftermarket unit. Hth. Steve G\n\nlook at tsbs .there is a section on radio codes .code 10 refers to broken drive belt or tight tape\n\nTry a different tape. If the code is still there the radio will have to be sent out to replace a broken belt.\n\nThis code mean the tape is tight, and the player can't turn the tape. Take tape out check for tightness or try another tape.\n\nhave you removed the fuses to cut off power to radio or unplug the radio and plug it back in Some times there is a glitch like a computer and they lock up. Let me know if this helps you WHITEY\n\nHere are some code meanings, looks like the tape player feature is indeed inop, unless it was just the tape itself. Cassette Errors • E10 or TIGHT TAPE: Tight tape error Cause(s): A restricted cassette tape transport or broken cassette drive belt Correction: Substitute a different cassette tape. If there still is an error code, service the unit at an ACDelco® Service Center. • E11 or BROKEN TAPE: Broken Tape Error Cause(s): A broken cassette tape Correction(s): Substitute a different cassette tape • E12 : Communication Error Cause(s): A vehicle/radio communication problem or an internal radio communication problem Correction(s): Disconnect the battery voltage to the radio then reconnect after a few minutes. If there still is an error, service the unit at an ACDelco® Service Center. • E13 : Tape Communication Error Cause(s): The micro-processor is reading the speed pulses from the tape deck either too fast or too slow. Correction(s): It the tape player is still playing a cassette, try a new cassette. If there is still an error, service the unit at an ACDelco® Service Center. • E14 or WRAPPED TAPE: Wrapped Tape Cause(s): The tape is wrapped around the capstan. This means a tape is wound up in the tape player. This error message could appear when a CD adapter is being used. Other causes could be old or damaged tapes. Long playing (90 or 120 minute) tapes are thin and can stretch easily creating this condition. Correction(s): Try playing a known good quality tape. Remove the CD adapter. • Cln Tape Indicator Cause(s): This message appears after 50 hours of accumulated tape play. Correction(s): We suggest cleaning the tape head. Then reset the radio by depressing the eject button for five seconds. Cleaning the heads will not reset the \"Cln\" display. To reset the \"Cln\" display, push and hold the eject button for five seconds. The display will return to its normal display.",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your error code 10 when inserting a tape, this indicates a \"TIGHT TAPE\" error. This means either:\n\n1. The tape itself is too tight and the player can't turn it\n2. There's a restricted cassette tape transport\n3. The cassette drive belt is broken\n\nHere's what you can try:\n- Test a different cassette tape first to rule out a problem with the specific tape\n- If the error persists with multiple tapes, it's likely a mechanical issue with the player\n\nIf these basic troubleshooting steps don't work, you have a few options:\n1. Take it to a repair shop that specializes in car audio - some shops can replace the drive belt or gears\n2. Replace with another factory radio from a junkyard\n3. Upgrade to an aftermarket radio\n\nThe repair is possible but might cost more than the radio is worth unless you're attached to keeping it original. Since your CD player still works fine, you might consider just living without the tape function if you don't use it often.\n\nTo reset the error, you can try disconnecting the battery for a few minutes, but this likely won't fix a mechanical issue.\n</ANSWER>"

This 1998 Volvo S70 is a 2.4L / 5 cyl / Gas engine with 4-speed Automatic Transaxle (Electronic) transmission.\nDelivery system: Fuel Injection Affected component: Shift Linkage Auto Trans Conditions: Faults In Control Unit",
         "This car came in without reverse and we pulled the trans and sent it to our trans guy. The ownwer of this car has a aftermarket warranty so we had to call and get approval for a reman trans from Volvo. Well the company would not allow us to get a reman and had a junk yard trans sent to us. Now here is what happened. They sent us a trans from a 99 Y/M car and it has continued to flip codes for gear position sensor (313). Now also the linkage took a lot of adjusting to get it to work and still doesn't line up all the way. It also feels as though it has an extra detent in the shift valve. Has anyone ever tried to install a 99 Y/M trans in a 98 Y/M car. Are they in fact different? The trans that came out of the car was a 1208956 and the one we got for a replacement was 1208919. Anyone had any experience in replacing these transmissions? My thanks to all that might be in the know of what trans fits what car.",
         "ray just looked at the parts info , the boxes will bolt up but they use differant linkage part numbers & gear change levers , and many other differances in the valve body solinoids.. 1208956 is for turbo 70 to 1998 . 1208919 is from 1999 to 2001 it looks like with tcu 9513245 , it has a diff tcu also\n\n98 and 99 S70's aren't even close to being the same. Engine and transmission mangement are not even close to similar. It sounds like you might have an early 2000 box as a replacement when they went to a 5 speed auto. I'm at home so I don't have a parts catalog, but that is the only thing that I can think of that would give the extra dedent. My suggestion is to change it out for the correct box. Richard Ewald Instructor Volvo Cars of North America\n\nI have no idea what your trans exchange problem may be, I just have some business advice, STAND UP TO THESE SCHLEP WARRANTY COMPANIES! I deal with them every day, good ones like Toyota extra care, GMPP, MIC, MPP, Chrysler extended Care, to name a few, never want you to put in a used unit, as you can see, this is risky business. DO NOT MAKE THESE HALF-ASSED COMPANIES PROBLEMS, YOURS! As soon as I realize I'm dealing with a half baked warranty company, I call the customer and VERY STRONGLY ADVISE THEM, IN FACT, NEARLY INSIST, that they take whatever the warranty co. is willing to pay for a used trans,pay the differance, have the trans fixed right! In the event that they insist that I put in the used trans, I make the warranty co. secure the trans, provide their own shipping, so there is no doubt as to who's responsibility this used trans is. I also discuss with the warranty co.what they do when this unit fails, what they pay to re-install, if they pay me storage while they jerk me & the customer around, etc. have them put it in writing, & fax it to me. I let the customer know all of this, so they know that it is not me jerking them around! Anyone with a '98 Volvo, indeed any car that they want to hang on to, should want it fixed right, and are foolish if they accept the used trans, and are just as culpable as the half-baked warranty co. at that point, and if they then get jerked around they are getting what THEY asked for, JUST MAKE IT CLEAR FROM THE START THAT THE USED TRANS OPTION IS USUALLY A BAD ONE,AND YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH IT, AND YOU WILL NOT, IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT, I have had foolish customers & warranty co.s put in 3 or 4 used units that either failed on the lift, or shortly thereafter, and even with all of my warnings to the contrary, they wind up resenting ME for it. So if you are going to be put in a position to potentially be jerked around, make it clear to all involved that you are advising against it, and intend to get paid well for it.",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on the information provided, there are significant differences between the 1998 and 1999 Volvo S70 transmissions that are causing your compatibility issues:\n\n1. The transmission boxes will physically bolt up, but they use different:\n   - Linkage part numbers\n   - Gear change levers\n   - Valve body solenoids\n   - TCU (Transmission Control Unit)\n\n2. Your original transmission (1208956) is specifically for turbo S70s up to 1998, while the replacement (1208919) is for 1999-2001 models with TCU 9513245.\n\n3. The 98 and 99 S70s have completely different engine and transmission management systems, which explains the gear position sensor codes (313) you're experiencing.\n\n4. The extra detent you're feeling could indicate you received a 2000 model box when they switched to 5-speed automatics.\n\nYour best solution is to replace it with the correct transmission box for your 1998 model. This is a classic example of why aftermarket warranty companies using junkyard parts can be problematic.\n\nFor future reference with warranty companies, consider:\n- Standing firm on getting the correct parts\n- Having the warranty company secure and ship used parts themselves\n- Getting written confirmation of what they'll cover if the used part fails\n- Clearly documenting your professional recommendations\n</ANSWER>"

It's still got the original factory drums, in excellent shape. I cut them, and they still drag mustily, in forward rotation. I kept releasing the adjustment back, with no avail. The parking brake cables are fine, and lose. Once you remove the torque from the wheel nuts, the problem is gone. After I kept releasing the adjustment, and still dragging, I took the wheel off, and the drum was very lose on the brake shoes. I used a WBR brake shoes from world pack, because the grab better than regular shoes. They look like a metallic compound in the shoes. The shoes are installed correct, the short one in the front, that is how they come out, and people on you Tube said. Is there a proportional valve in the back that could do this? I haven't tried to open the bleeder. The fact that the removal of the wheel, gives the slack back, makes me believe, that the torque of the wheel appears to cause it. Can't make the connection to this. It didn't have this problem before. Thanks for any help you can provide. Alfie.",
         "Sounds like the brake drum is contacting something - most likely the outer edge of the brake shoes or the backing plate. Bolt the drums on with the lug nuts and turn the drums several times, then take them off and look for witness marks. It might help to put paint on the likely interference surfaces if the first try doesn't show you what's contacting. I don't like the idea of using brake shoes that \"grab better\" than OE, especially on rear brakes. A lot of aftermarket brake shoe friction compounds caused performance problems on both front and rear wheel GM vehicles back then - too \"grabby\". Good luck - hope this helps.\n\nI agree with Phil..sounds like the shoes are too wide and when the lug nuts torgue down, it causes them to drag on the drum face OR forces them into the backing plate..is the backing plate and backing plate contact area in the drum nice and clean?....I too dont like the \"grabby\" shoes on these old beasts.\n\nI also agree. There has to be something getting jammed when you tighten the wheel nuts and the most likely candidate is the shoes are probably too wide. This is another thing where you may have too much of a good thing and that is the grabby shoes. The ABS may help make them a little more acceptable, but why introduce addl problems to a system that did the job.\n\n20 year old drums are probably not holding the torque,flexing in at the center.\n\nMatch up the old brake shoes with the new ones, I'm sure you'll find your problem\n\nAlmost sounds like the shoes are too wide and catch on the edge of the shoe when you tighten it down. Did you check for that? I don't think your problem is from the shoes being adjusted too tightly. I think you should look for something else to do with the brakes dragging, such as what I mentioned above.\n\nI had that same problem on a cadillac years ago it was the brake shoes, I would try a different set of shoes.\n\nI had that same problem on a cadillac years ago it was the brake shoes, I would try a different set of shoes.\n\ni think brake shoes are to wide good luck\n\nWould agree that most likely the brake shoes are incorrect BUT you ought to be able to look at the inside of the drum and/or the edge of the shoes and see where it's scraping if it's the shoe width that's the problem. The only other issue may be corrosion built up on the hub that's causing the drum to warp when it's tightened down. Maybe a light coat of black spray-can paint on the inside of the drum could help ID the contact point (wipe back off with brake cleaner when you're done). HTH\n\nHii Alfiero Sounds like the new shoes are to wide check the width of the old ones compared to the new ones been there done this before good luck\n\nI'd try new shoes. We don't use WBR shoes anymore because of fitment issues like this, and because of excessive dusting.\n\nShoes probably too wide. Compare them to the original ones.\n\nSounds like the edge of shoes need to be beveled I do it to all of my shoes just so I don't gotta go back I even bevel the front and rear so it has a smoother transition while braking\n\nCould the brake shoes be a tad to wide. measure the old ones for width. Seems everything else has been looked at. Maybe re install the one side of old set of shoes adjust like new and torque the wheel. Does the same thing happen? if not then the new shoes have a problem.Hope this helps\n\nHi, would have to agree with everyone else that the shoes are too wide, maybe not the linings but the webbing it self. Good luck, Andy\n\nAs the others say too wide brake shoes. But Phil could be right if the edges are pulling up. Could there just be so much rust on the drum and backing plate? Are the axle flanges or backing plates bent?\n\nare the shoes too wide ? or produced wrong. compare to old shoes for size and be sure wheel cylinders are correct size.\n\nSounds like you have the wrong shoes- they are too wide. As you tighten down the wheel the drum presses on the edge of the shoes and will lock it up. Measure the width of the old shoes and compare.\n\nTry a different set of shoes\n\nShim the drums [use some washers] on each stud and tighten drums down and see if it helps. At least you would know if the shoes are contacting the backing plates. DO NOT LEAVE THE WASHERS ON THE STUDS, PERMANENTLY.\n\nLook in the drum, if you see a shoulder where the drum isn't machined back to the drum face its machined wrong! That shoulder needs cut out so the entire area is flat, I've seen this several times. The only other things it can be is either wrong ( too wide) or poorly manufactured shoes!\n\nFirst make sure your lathe cut to the bottom of the drum. Then install new rivited name brand shoes.Make sure you can slap shoes side to side to center.Then grind a small amount of lining off outside edge of shoes.If vechicle does not stop good, most stopping power is on the front.hope this helps\n\nAs stated above, need to find out where/how they are dragging. If only one side, I was thinking maybe cracked drum. If both and didn't do it before, likely bad tolerance on parts.\n\nEither the shoes are wrong width or thickness. The park brake cable could be hanging up also. Are the shoes against the pivot pin at top? If they are not the cable or cables are stuck.\n\ndouble check the width of the new brake shoes,they might be slightly wider then the old ones and causing the shoes to drag on the drums when the wheels are tightened up\n\nEverybody is assuming original wheels; If they are aftermarket, it may be necessary to use a 1/8 or even 1/4 spacer between hub and rim; I've even found this on OEM wheels from a different year than the vehicle. At least it's a cheap experiment, to help narrow down the problem.\n\nOn rare occasions I have incurred this on multiple types of vehicles. Every time the drum was dragging on the edge of the brake shoe. Another set of shoes fixed them all.\n\ntry putting the drum on different studs and see if it helps. axle flange or drum center maybe off.\n\nAlfiero, Agree sounds like I would match old shoes w new.\n\nTry putting new brake hardware; springs, pins and all the other parts that come in a kit.\n\nGlad it ended well. Hint: check your spelling so that no one is offended.\n\nMakes me wonder if there is a left and right with those shoes. That could account for the 'web' being off-center, if I'm reading your thoughts correctly.",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, it sounds like your new brake shoes are too wide and are causing drag when the wheel is torqued down. This is a common issue with aftermarket brake shoes, especially \"grabby\" ones like the WBR World Pack shoes you installed.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n1. Compare the width of your new shoes to the original ones - they're likely wider, which causes them to contact the drum when tightened.\n\n2. Look for witness marks by applying some paint to the inside of the drum, installing it with lug nuts, rotating it several times, then removing to see where contact is occurring.\n\n3. Consider replacing the shoes with standard OEM-equivalent shoes rather than the \"grabby\" metallic compound ones. Many experienced mechanics avoid these enhanced friction shoes on rear brakes of these vehicles as they can cause performance issues.\n\n4. Check that the backing plate and contact areas are clean and free of rust or debris.\n\n5. Make sure the drum was properly machined all the way to the edge with no \"shoulder\" that could catch on the shoes.\n\nThe fact that removing wheel torque eliminates the problem strongly suggests it's a fitment issue with the shoes, not a hydraulic problem like a proportioning valve. This is why the drums are loose on the shoes when removed but drag when installed with torque.\n</ANSWER>"

         "When starting it will click multiple times. Sounds like a dead battery clicks. The ecm provides power to the start relay coil, and you can watch it on a meter going 0.x volts up and down with each click when it gets high enough (over six volts)it will start.Someone had soldered a wire to the relay pole (terminal 85)and installed a start button on the dash. Direct battery voltage when button pushed (It would crank) all the other circuits at the relay check good.. This also sent battery voltage to the ecm start signal wire. Which is why the relay and ecm were replaced.I don't see the exhaust cam position sensor counting up with key on. Or any codes. If you have specific information about a Sonic with this symptom. I would appreciate your help.",
         "Seems like a major issue with these. There is a cheesy lock/unlock sequence supposed to help, but who knows...http://www.lemonl...ic-starting-problem/\n\nI am assuming you are checking voltage at the relay? Check voltage coming out of PCM on pin 17 in x1 connector, if you have 12 volts there and not at pin 85 of the relay you have a bag fuse box. If you don't have voltage at pin 17, load test powers and grounds at PCM.\n\nHi Kenny,Looking at a schematic, I would want to know if the PCM could produce good voltage at pin 17 connector X1 (yell wire), if the PCM can produce good voltage there unhooked, I would then measure the voltage at PCM, the relay and the starter with everything connected. It is possible there is a poor connection or voltage drop present.If the PCM is not able to produce the correct voltage, I would be checking the powers and grounds in to it. Good luck with it.Sam\n\nkenny, push putton! i would start there put it back to stock.\n\nI had one of these. Put a volt meter on the battery and watch it whilst you're trying to crank it over. The one I worked on the battery voltage would drop down to 8v at times then I'd look and it would be 12v. I tested it with a Midtronics and it passed. So I load tested a few times and the voltage would drop to 10v then 9v then I'd let the battery sit for a minute and the voltage would go back to 12v. I've been at this since 1972 and I've never had a battery do this. ~Cheers~\n\nvoltage drop as the last tech mentioned what is battery doing ,what is voltage at starter\n\nVoltage drop test the power and ground circuits at the ECM connectors and the relay.A bad connection at the fuse block connector or ECM can cause this.The BCM is the ignition mode master and it sends a serial data message to the ECM for crank request so monitor the data as well.\n\nhas to be a voltage drop, i agree with what out5hers have said\n\nOhms law still applies to a Sonic or any other car.I have 30 years experience and told you to monitor BCM ignition mode data while you are cranking to see if the crank request stays on.I will not try to help you again.I am a GM Master Tech and have worked on these Daewoo cars.\n\nI understand the desire for vehicle specific help, but many times that is not available.Is there any chance of a scope capture/file? If you are not sure how to upload a file and link it I could run you through the process.I would still like to see out of the ecm, at the fuse box and at the starter. The newer vehicle fuse boxes are of a low quality and fail often.If all three of these voltages are very close, most likely there is a input problem to the ecm. Seems unlikely that a new ecm would be defective, but that is also a possibility.Good luck, Sam\n\nKenny,Here is a link to a Sonic forum with a no crank concern. It probably will not give you a fix but some times the enthusiast forums will give you an idea to try.http://www.sonico...arting-no-crank.htmlSam\n\nDoes this car have an aftermarket remote starter?\n\n......Please add your comments if a solution is reached....Dan H....\n\n......I fail to see what you said or did(or didn't do) that pizzed off Mr.MM so bad that he would now with hold any future help he might (could) send your way....Dan H....\n\nheres what you might try.........Hook up to scan tool; see what the computer sees when cranking; this will tell you if you have a steady signal to the computer from the ignition switch-if you have a steady signal (when cranking), chances are the computer needs to be reflashed because the starter relay is not being powered up long enough...........ive seen this a couple times over the years..........cant remember make and model but it does happen.............\n\nI think I came off wrong with my last post.I meant since I have not had this particular problem with a Sonic I would shut up since he said I could not help.I am not mad but wanted to remind him we all forget we are not perfect and can forget something and even someone who has never seen one of these may be able to help.I do this to help and keep my brain functioning,lol.I have over 400 GM certifications and will help.I am not a paying member and have only asked for help 1 time on a Ford.I am sorry if it sounded like I was ticked but I was just doing as Mr Alley asked.I will help when I can and stop when told I can not help.I will help him again when he posts.\n\nA voltage drop on the ground side has played with me on several cars.I am glad you found it and the fix is what matters in the end.Like I said Ohms Law applies to every electrical circuit.High resistance = lower current flow.There is a very good video on you tube that I recommend watching https://youtu.be/9oM8_U0rB9AMotor age has lots of good videos like this.\n\nGood Post!",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, this sounds like a voltage drop issue, likely on the ground side. Here's what I recommend:\n\n1. Check voltage at multiple points:\n   - Measure voltage at PCM pin 17 in X1 connector (yellow wire)\n   - Compare voltage readings at the PCM, relay, and starter with everything connected\n   - Monitor battery voltage during cranking attempts (if it drops below 10V and then recovers to 12V, that's suspicious)\n\n2. Perform voltage drop tests:\n   - Test power and ground circuits at the ECM connectors and relay\n   - Check for poor connections at the fuse block connector\n   - The newer vehicle fuse boxes are known to be low quality and fail frequently\n\n3. Consider these potential issues:\n   - The BCM sends a serial data message to the ECM for crank request - monitor this data\n   - The aftermarket start button modification may have caused damage\n   - Return the starting system to stock configuration if possible\n\nThis is a known issue with Sonics. High resistance in a circuit = lower current flow, which explains the clicking and intermittent voltage. Check all ground connections thoroughly as ground-side voltage drops have caused similar symptoms in other vehicles.\n</ANSWER>"

This 1999 Jaguar XJR is a 4.0L / 8 cyl / Gas engine with 5-speed Automatic Transmission (Electronic) transmission.\nDelivery system: Fuel Injection Affected component: Abs/ Traction Ctl. Conditions: Inop",
         "Hello fellow Jaguar techs.! I got this cat here with a ABS/ Stability Ctl./ Traction control message. Also, the speedometer is intermittently inop, when speedo is inop, Transmission Failure message appears,( obviously), no speed signal= no Trans control, cool. This particular car has a Mercedes Benz tranny 722.635 which we have rebuilt many and we know the transmission is good, we even took the valve body out and replaced the solenoids and both turbine speed sensors. Now, I got 2 questions for you guys: does the speedo on this Jag take speed info from the ABS module like the Benz does? if so, I know what to look for next. Does anyone know FOR SURE? not guessing, Alldata, Mitchell 5, and Autodata have very poor diagrams on this system and I hate to pay $200 to use manufacturers website. Second question: The wheel speed sensors on this car are OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE, has anyone found a cheap replacement for them (like Ford, MBZ, or any other sensor that might work? I got to get the ABS module working before I can get CAN readings. I'm not all for hacking cars but Im trying to do a little more affordable troubleshooting. Thanks. P.S the part # for the sensor is LJA2226AA",
         "If you get a C1095 and codes for the front wheel speed sensors from the ABS control module, then it is most likely a bad ABS module. BTW, its usually the harness not the sensor if it does come down to sensor issues. Jag was smart enough to make the harness relaceable. I do believe the primary speed data is sent accross the CAN network from the ABS module. However, if the data is missing it will calculate from other sources.\n\nDitto what Brian said. I've had a lot of Jags with bad harnesses going to the wheel speed sensors.\n\nThese vehicles do get their speed information from abs module. Wheel speed sensors rarely fail,the harnesses are the bits that fail. Abs faults also can be from pump motor failure due to dry soldered joints at pump wiring on circuit board in module.Easy fix with 1\" hole saw at back of pump terminals ,resolder and plug hole with a grommet.$$$$ saved. You must hook up a scan tool that can interface with these vehicles otherwise you are flying blind.Launch are not good with these sort of situations.\n\ncan U communicate w/abs_tcs?? what codes do U have??\n\nI can let you know a far more convenient place to get the circuit diagrams if you tell me your email addy.\n\nwhat codes did you retreive from abs computer and what diagnostic computer are you using.paul\n\nOscar,Check torque of rear axle nuts.I have had 2 cars with a loose nut & then the abs ring spins freely at times.John\n\nIt gets the speed signal from the abs. Most of the time the fly lead going to the sensor goes bad and it is not that much. very easy to test just disconnect it at the sensor and then in the engine compartment and then ohm out the wires.\n\nOscar, On the questionable ABS module, I have had a bad one or few and BBA Reman fixes them for less than $200. I was told that if a unit that came from another car was put on it had to be programmed so that is a benefit of having the original unit repaired. I got the idea that this is a common problem. The unit can be removed without opening brake fluid lines also. Hope this helps some.\n\nHi Oscar, harness link leads were problematic, wish u well, Rob",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on the information provided, your Jaguar XJR is likely experiencing issues related to the ABS module and/or wheel speed sensor wiring.\n\nSeveral key points to help you:\n\n1. Yes, the speedometer on your Jag does take speed information from the ABS module via the CAN network. When this data is missing, the car will try to calculate from other sources, which explains your intermittent speedometer and transmission failure messages.\n\n2. For the wheel speed sensors (part #LJA2226AA), before replacing the expensive sensors themselves, check the harnesses first. Multiple techs confirm that it's usually the harnesses that fail, not the sensors themselves. Jaguar designed these with replaceable harnesses, which is much more cost-effective.\n\n3. Diagnostic approach:\n   - Use a proper scan tool that can interface with Jaguar systems to pull ABS/TCS codes\n   - Check the fly leads going to the sensors by disconnecting at both the sensor and engine compartment ends, then ohm out the wires\n   - Inspect the torque of rear axle nuts (loose nuts can cause the ABS ring to spin freely)\n   - Look for dry soldered joints at the pump wiring on the circuit board in the ABS module\n\n4. If the ABS module itself is bad, consider using BBA Reman who can fix them for less than $200, which is much cheaper than a new unit. Using your original repaired unit avoids programming issues that might occur with a replacement unit.\n\nThis appears to be a common issue with these vehicles, and checking the harnesses should be your first step before investing in expensive sensors.\n</ANSWER>"

Check each sensor with an ohm meter.",
         "<ANSWER>\nFor your 2005 Porsche Cayenne S with the brake wear indicator light issue:\n\nThe most likely reason the light won't turn off is that you need to replace the brake wear sensors, not just the pads and rotors. Here's what to check:\n\n1. Make sure you replaced the brake wear sensors along with the pads and rotors\n2. Verify all sensors are properly connected to their correct sockets\n3. You can test each sensor with an ohmmeter to confirm they're functioning\n\nUnlike some BMWs, there's no special reset sequence needed for the Cayenne.

         "The door locks activate and de-activate normaly except for the front pass door which will at times not permit the occupant to exit the door. While the trouble is occuring the door will not allow exterior entry as well, even with the exterior key in use on that door.The second problem is the alarm arming tone is also intermittant.As mentioned earlier the system fails the security system self test; 1) Arm system w/the key from either the drivers or pass door key 2) Lift all 4 locks within 10 sec. (The locks are not pulled down and the pump does not activate as our MOD information indicates it should.)And the second part of the test Quote; (cannot perform this one because we fail the first) 1)After the first test pulls all the locks down again and the pump runs, wait 15 seconds and pull all 4 locks up again in succession. ( wait 24 seconds after locking drivers door) It should now not be possible to unlock the doors, at the same time the pump should start back up and pull the lock knobs back. At the same time , the door lock is deactivated and no longer possible to open the door. 2) repeat proceedure using the passenger's door.With the limited information available I can only assume that the door latch or vacuum solinoid are faulty on the first complaint. The self test on the second part indicates that the controller is capable of holding the door locks down and making the door incapable of opening. Does the controller apply vacuum w/a single control solinoid or does it have multiple solinoids for the various doors inside the controller? If it has multiple lock control solinoids in the controller that is seems posible that the lock on the pass front door could be an intermittant non op due to vacuum holding on this door and be the fault of the controller.Tsb and Iatn archive searches found nothing on this trouble.Visual inspection of the latch and solinoid assembly show nothing (High tech modular assemblies! do they think this thing is going to the moon or what?)(Crack does more than kill)What do you think?

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description of the intermittent door lock issues with the passenger front door and alarm arming tone problems, this sounds like a classic VW door wiring harness failure.\n\nCheck these areas specifically:\n1. Examine the wiring harness/umbilical cord that runs between the A-pillar and the door on both doors, especially the passenger side. These are notorious failure points in VWs of this era.\n2. Look for broken wires in the door jambs - this is a very common issue that causes exactly the symptoms you're describing.\n3. Pay special attention to the brown wire in the driver's door loom - this is often the culprit.\n\nThe intermittent nature of both problems (door lock and alarm tone) strongly suggests a wiring issue rather than a mechanical problem with the latch or vacuum system. The broken wires create inconsistent electrical connections that explain why the security system fails the self-test and why the door sometimes traps occupants.\n\nStart with a thorough inspection of these wiring areas before replacing any components.

         "Hello I have this jeep that is running hot, the jeep came in skipping so we checked it out and it had a blowed headgasket.We installed a jasper reman engine with the install kit and we put a new radiator in it. it continues to run hot we have three different temp gauges the dash gauge the scanner and a manual temp gauge. Ive replaced the waterpump and thermostat again just to make sure the waterpump was right it has r stamped on the impeller and the water pump is turning counter clockwise. I took the heater hose off the thermostat housing and started the jeep up and no water will come out the hose unless I give it 1500 or so rpm. I called jasper and told them everything we have tried,so they sent another engine, we installed it still running 230- 240 going down the road. the electric fan is working and the clutch fan is good both fans are pulling air very good and the a/c condenser is clean.it has a winch bumper on it so we took it off and put a piece of tin in the place were the bumper went to make sure air was going threw the radiator.i looked at the jasper engine that we pulled out thinking headgasket installed wrong but it wasn't. the only thing I seen was the engine had .075 piston stamped on top. im going to try this morning bypassing the heater core because I read on another iatn post the heater core hoses can get crossed and make it run hot, not sure about that but at this point anything is possible.i was wondering it seems like the heater hose should be pumping water at idle to because if not the heater would blow cold at idle. And can these engines be bored .075 and not build heat the cooling system cant get rid of.I took the center out of the thermostat and just put the outside ring of the thermostat back in and ran it it cooled down to about 224 degrees and ive tried 180 and 195 degree thermostats no difference. thanks for any help don't no what to do next",
         "Shipping cap/plug not removed from replacement radiator???...I've read of that happening....maybe a bogus radiator....install the old one and see if it works any better.(as a test)...That \"R\" has me wondering, too....Dan Habluetzel....South Texas...\n\nSerpentine belt ...or...V-Belt ???...Serp's usually are counter-rotators...maybe you got a V- type pump...just a thought....Dan Habluetzel....again...\n\n...and...as a side note ...thermostats control MINIMUM operating temps...note: A wide open 160° stat is NO MORE wide open than a wide open 195° stat is...why would it make an \"overheater\" NOT overheat (still)...just so you know....Dan H.\n\nHad this problem before and it turned out to be the heater core was clogged, and the radiator was clogged as well due to using that dex cool that the customer used.Just a thought.\n\nAre you sure you've got the belt on correct? It is possible to have the belt on the wp backwards and still achieve belt tension.\n\nI called Mr. MoPar parts monkey in the adjacent town and he said there are two different pumps shown for a '96 Jeep 4.0L(one CCW and one CW)...I'd bet you have the wrong one on your's... after that conversation....but remember ...he's a parts monkey....Dan H....one mo time...\n\nI'm on board with wrong water pump, fought this problem a few times myself, at this point I would try the other possibility, what do you have to lose. Good luck.\n\nCCW is correct rotation.I usually fill these with Temp sender out until they flow out the hole & then put sender back.This seems to help eliminate air pockets.Had one with a rag caught in the hose from expansion tank that gave the same problem.\n\nThere has to be something plugged up if the belt routing and water pump are correct! I would first order both water pumps and compare them to insure the correct one is used in this application. At that point blow air through each of the hoses to make sure they're open. If this has a mechanical fan reve the engine while standing in front and verify the air is being pulled through the radiator and not pushed backwards through it because of belt routing or wrong fan blade ( I've seen it!). Let us know what you find, good luck\n\n98% chance wrong water pump... 2% chance the lower hose is full of stop-leak, a rag, or a shipping plug. Jeep 4.0's usually insist on a vacuum coolant fill. Blocking off the heater hoses will guarantee an overheat; there MUST be circulation through that circuit for the thermostat to open, and remaining air to purge. Wrong water pump from a previous repair might be the root cause of overheat/head gasket failure.I'm currently driving an '89 with 290,xxx miles on it as my daily beater, so I've had some practice.\n\nTry another water pump. Make sure you have the correct belt routing. Coolant should flow from heater hoses even at a dead idle.\n\nI am thinking you have a possible have a water pump issue or a heater core issue. I would check your new pump against the original to see if it has the proper impeller . Also bypass the heater core or try flushing it with a garden hose and see what kind of flow you have\n\nHad an issue similar to yours. Check the water pump impeller. The one I changed impeller was cracked in half. I just slapped in a new one and yes it was the wrong water pump.good luck\n\nAre you sure the pistons are marked .075, and not 0.75, which would be the metric equivalent of .030\".\n\nTry another water pump\n\nTry matching the blades of the new pump against the old one. If you don't have the old pump just call the dealer and order one per vin. Also remove lower radiator hose and the radiator should empty out in less than 3 seconds if it's flowing good\n\npull some hoses and check water pump flow if good then look for a blockage in the new radiator\n\nI've seen similar issues with these. Both times the wrong water pump was the problem. When they switched to serpentine belts the pump direction was reversed. Perhaps that was the root cause of the earlier failure.\n\nI shouldn't find your dilemma funny, but I do.Every time I hear Jasper I cringe. Also every time I here about the 4.0L water pump issue I am reminded of when the CW vs. CCW change was made.Back then if you did not purchase new pumps some rebuilders didn't know the difference and craps, what a mess.Now when I hear Jasper I am reminded again.I can still remember the Chrysler tech line telling me that I didn't purge the system correctly.Before I forget, do a flow test of the heater hoses to be certain that you have strong circulation, both into an out of the core.Anyway, I hope this solves your problem.\n\ntry this on the drivers side at the rear of the engine head there is a temp sensor or a plug remove the sensor or plug start engine till coolant come out, temp on those engines generally run higher temps\n\nThinking wrong water pump or a restricted radiator, maybe from those radiator plugs which come on the new radiator.\n\nHi Jamie, Think of your cooling system comprised of three components. Engine cooling jacket, radiator and heater loop. Each part can be tested for flow with a garden hose one component at a time. If there is low flow in one of three or more you know it will overheat. You will get the feel of how much flow to experience with the garden hose flowing. Be sure to reclaim any coolant before you start the process. BMW coolant is good to run after a thorough flush and chase with 100 PSI compressed air. The engine runs clockwise when facing the vibration dampner. Any pulley with the belt on the bottom or on the left will automatically turn CCW. The water pump belt is on the left and it will turn CCW. Good Luck, Gary\n\nWatch the aftermarket radiators could be your issue\n\nI used to own a 1995 XJ Cherokee with a 4.0 engine when I worked at a Jeep dealer a few years ago and had a similar problem with mine....after repeated flushing of the complete system,heater core and 2 different stock replacement radiators I went to my local Car Quest store and ordered an \"extreme duty\" 3 row radiator...may have been 2 but it had double the rows of cooling tubes the stock one had.Problem was solved and no further issues....Also fixed 2 mail route Wranglers with similar problems by doing thatTim Terry Jacks 5 Star Clinic Inc.

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your symptoms, there are several potential causes for your Jeep Cherokee running hot:\n\n1. **Water Pump Issues**: This is the most likely culprit. The 4.0L Jeep engines can use two different water pumps (clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation). Even though your pump has the \"R\" stamp and turns CCW, it might still be the wrong pump for your application. Compare it with an OEM pump specifically for your VIN.\n\n2. **Cooling System Blockage**: Check for:\n   - Shipping plugs left in the new radiator\n   - Clogged heater core (try bypassing it temporarily)\n   - Blockage in the lower radiator hose\n   - Restricted radiator flow\n\n3. **Air in the System**: These Jeeps often require a vacuum coolant fill to properly purge air. Air pockets can prevent proper circulation.\n\n4. **Radiator Capacity**: The stock radiator may not be sufficient. Some owners have solved similar issues by upgrading to a higher capacity aftermarket radiator with more cooling rows.\n\n5. **Belt Routing**: Verify the belt is routed correctly. It's possible to have tension but incorrect routing.\n\nTroubleshooting steps:\n- Flow test the heater hoses (should have strong circulation even at idle)\n- Remove the lower radiator hose to check flow (should empty in under 3 seconds)\n- Try installing a known OEM water pump ordered by your VIN\n- Consider upgrading to a higher capacity radiator\n\nThe .075 overbore shouldn't cause this level of overheating if the cooling system is functioning properly.\n</ANSWER>"

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your symptoms with the 1997 Toyota Camry (P0171 lean condition, sluggish performance under load, won't rev past 3,000 RPM at full throttle), there are several likely causes to investigate:\n\n1. **Timing belt issue** - This appears to be the most common suggestion. Your timing belt may have jumped a tooth or more. This would explain both the performance issues and lean condition. Double-check all timing marks carefully.\n\n2. **Important note**: Your 2.2L Camry uses a MAP sensor system, not a MAF sensor (several responses incorrectly suggested MAF issues).\n\n3. **Vacuum leaks** - Check for any vacuum leaks, especially from the brake booster or intake manifold. These can cause lean conditions.\n\n4. **Air/Fuel Ratio Sensor** - The A/F sensor could be lazy or out of calibration. This would directly affect your P0171 code and performance.\n\n5. **Fuel delivery** - While your pressure tests good at 51 psi, check the fuel filter as it could be restricting flow under load.\n\n6. **Compression test** - Run a compression test to verify engine mechanical condition. Should be around 175-180 psi.\n\nI'd start with verifying the timing belt position as this is the most likely culprit given your symptoms and is relatively easy to check. The combination of lean condition and power loss under load strongly points to a timing issue.\n</ANSWER>"

         "hello,I have this 2008 S80 with the 3.0 turbo.It was dropped off with the complaint of hesitation and not running right.I have driven it about 50 miles over tha last couple of days and it yet to act up for me.I scanned it and got these codes that I have never experienced before.since I did not experience it when it acts up I could use a little help.Volvo's description of P1170-68 is engine shut off solenoid algorithm failure.then it notes that this code is an event controlled diagnostic code that does NOT mean there is a fault in the control module,but is designated as information.OKmove on to p061-A62 it is described as internal control module torque performance algorithm failure,signal compare failure.listing as possible causes are air leakage,damaged throttle unit,damaged maf,damaged ect,damaged crank sensor,damaged air pressure sensor,and bad turbo,vvt or ecm.[is that all?]p061B64 is basically the same as A62.since as I stated the car is running fine at this time I am hoping this series of codes point to something that you could point out to me.as you can see it is basically telling me that it could be anything.I monitored data stream while driving everything looked OK,and codes did not return after clearing for about 50 miles or so.thanks in advancethanks in advance",
         "Those are common ghost codes that I always ignore.Justin\n\nDoes it have latest software in the ECM/TCM? Check boost pressure sensor.\n\nI am not sure but I had a few Volvos with bad throttle bodies. I would check with Volvo if this year had the problem with the throttle body. Volvo covered the throttlebody for free on the one I had. I hope this helps\n\nThe fuel trims would be a big help. Also, be sure that the boost pressure sensor is working great and the car is actually building boost . If the trims are ok and they match what the o2 sensors are doing then good , but check for fuel trims to be adding fuel but lean o2 voltages , that can indicate a skewed or dirty MAF. . Use OE brands only ... these cars do not like Aftermarket brand sensors\n\nSounds like conflict's with PCM's long as all looks good on serial pids I would ck for mirror on trace (make sure pcm's are not in conflict).HTH\n\nYou really need to know what happened during the failure. but, you didn't mention ff data. If the volvo scanner does not show them, I have often been surprised to find that FF is available in generic oBD2 data. Weird but true. Sounds like an intake leak that only leaks under the right temp/pressure, and that would be evident in the FF fuel trims. Good luck\n\nWe have had this same issue with this model check to see if the temp is correct or the fuel pressure at the control unit. We have a lot of issues with the fuel temp/press sensor. The other thing is the spark plugs are due about now we get a lot of out of range type codes because they are trying to compensate for the worn plugs.\n\nI've replaced a few intake manifold gaskets on older 6-cyl Volvos. But I can't recall how the intake is put together on the T6. Spray some combustible product where intake meets the head and see if numbers change, esp Short Term Fuel Trim.",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description of the 2008 S80 T6 with hesitation issues and the codes you're seeing, here are some insights:\n\nThese codes (P1170-68, P061A-62, P061B64) are often \"ghost codes\" that many Volvo techs tend to ignore when the vehicle is running properly. Since you haven't experienced the hesitation issue yourself, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.\n\nSeveral things to check:\n\n1. ECM/TCM Software - Make sure the vehicle has the latest software updates\n\n2. Boost Pressure Sensor - This is a common culprit with these symptoms\n\n3. Throttle Body - Some Volvos from this era had known throttle body issues that Volvo sometimes covered for free. Worth checking with the dealer.\n\n4. Check Fuel Trims - These would be very helpful diagnostic data. Look for mismatches between fuel trims and O2 sensor readings which could indicate a dirty/faulty MAF sensor.\n\n5. Intake Leaks - Could be an intake manifold gasket that only leaks under specific temperature/pressure conditions. Try spraying some carb cleaner where the intake meets the head and watch for changes in Short Term Fuel Trim.\n\n6. Spark Plugs - At 106k miles, they're likely due for replacement and worn plugs can cause these compensation-related codes.\n\n7. Fuel Pressure/Temperature Sensor - These have been known to cause similar issues in this model.\n\nSince the car isn't currently exhibiting the problem, try to get freeze frame data when it does act up - sometimes this is available in generic OBD2 mode even if not shown in Volvo-specific diagnostics.\n\nUse only OE brand sensors if you need to replace any - these engines don't respond well to aftermarket parts.\n</ANSWER>"

         "<ANSWER>\nThe steering angle sensor (G85) for your 2011 Audi TT Quattro is actually integrated into the steering rack, not the clockspring assembly as the dealer parts department suggested. This is a common point of confusion because in earlier models (pre-mid 2011), the sensor was located on the clockspring, but Audi changed this design.\n\nFor 2011 TT models manufactured after mid-year, the G85 sensor is built into the steering rack itself. This explains why you couldn't find it when taking apart the steering column.\n\nThe issue you're experiencing with code 778 (no signal/communication from G85) is likely related to proper coding of the new rack rather than a defective sensor. This is a common challenge when replacing racks on VW/Audi vehicles.\n\nI recommend:\n1. Return to the dealer and specifically inform them that the G85 is integrated into the rack for your model year\n2. Request they attempt coding again with this knowledge\n3. If they insist it's defective, ask them to verify by checking the wiring connections to the rack first\n\nIf the dealer continues to have issues, consider finding a specialist shop with Audi/VW experience who might be more familiar with this specific model change.\n</ANSWER>"

         "This SUV comes in for service and we detect a coolant leak. Looking at the engine as best possible, we see coolant coming off the bottom of the water pump. We called the customer and gave him a price, but we told him we would make the final call on the water pump after we got the front pulley off the pump. Then we should be able to see were it is coming out of. We get the go ahead and pull the WP pulley and see coolant leaking right off the front of the pump. Install a new pump and refill with a vacu fill with no dropage of the vac gauge. Well, we still have a leak. It seems to be coming from underneath a steel plate that bolts to the front of the engine underneath the crank pulley. Is there a freeze plug underneath this plate or something else that I'm missing. BTW: This new GMC is real tight to work under and visiblity is bad. Jobs like this makes one wish they had gone into another field somedays.Thanks",
         "Rod, looking at block disassembly I don't see anything coolant related under frt cover. there are two expansion plugs under intake in valley.\n\nThe water pump is mounted on the timing chain cover.Weird,i bet is really hard to see where is leaking from,i'm thinking a cracked t.chain cover of head gasket.Good luck.\n\nhey rod as long as your pressure holds for 2 min it should be fine. Have you checked the oil also and made sure it wasn't milky?Also check tranny fluid. Or you just have a normal water pump failure or gasket gone bad..Good luck\n\nThat plate and foam is just a noise dampner. They do all they can to try and make these super quite. You will also notice there is expandable foam in the frame rails.\n\nRob, although I've not worked on one of these, I feel certain that the purpose of the foam is to reduce noise. I'm guessing that the steel plate was \"ringing\" at a certain frequency, during engineering development, and they added the foam to dampen out the vibrations. I wonder what the name of the part is (sound dampener?).",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, it sounds like you're dealing with a challenging coolant leak on this 2007 GMC Acadia. After reviewing the information, here's what you should know:\n\n1. The steel plate under the crank pulley is just a noise dampener - it's not related to the cooling system. There's foam attached to it specifically designed to reduce engine noise/vibration.\n\n2. There are no freeze plugs or coolant-related components under that front cover. The expansion plugs are located under the intake in the valley.\n\n3. The water pump is mounted directly on the timing chain cover, which could be the source of your leak. Since you've replaced the pump but still have a leak, you might be dealing with:\n   - A cracked timing chain cover\n   - A head gasket issue\n   - A gasket failure elsewhere in the system\n\nSince your vacuum test is holding pressure for the required time, that's a good sign. I'd recommend:\n- Check your oil for milkiness (indicating coolant contamination)\n- Check transmission fluid for contamination\n- Carefully inspect the timing chain cover for hairline cracks\n- Consider using UV dye in the coolant to better trace the leak source\n\nThese Acadias are notoriously tight to work on, so I understand your frustration. The limited visibility makes diagnosis particularly challenging.\n</ANSWER>"

That has been cleared and hasn't reappeared. We replaced the PNP switch like so many before and cleaned the mode switch on the shifter console. There was no change.

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, it sounds like your transmission is failing. The symptoms you're experiencing—working properly when cold but losing all forward and reverse gears when warm, along with the shrieking noise—are classic signs of internal transmission failure in these Volvo AW50/51 transmissions.\n\nUnfortunately, the consensus is that this transmission needs replacement. Here's why:\n\n1. The temperature-dependent failure pattern suggests internal component breakdown when the fluid heats up\n2. The shrieking noise followed by loss of engagement indicates clutch pack or valve body failure\n3. You've already replaced the common external culprits (PNP switch, cleaned mode switch)\n4. The fluid flush didn't resolve the issue\n\nThese transmissions cannot be effectively rebuilt as Volvo doesn't offer internal parts. Your options are:\n\n1. Replace with a remanufactured transmission\n2. Find a good used transmission (though this can be risky)\n3.

Before I disassembly the dash on this vehicle, I wanted to get some feedback and see if anyone has seen this before.

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your ABS light issue with your 1992 Mitsubishi 3000GT VR-4, there are several things to check before tearing into the dash:\n\n1. First, check if the vehicle has been in an accident - your symptoms suggest a possible ground issue. The 2V reading instead of battery voltage could indicate a poor ground connection for the ABS system.\n\n2. Verify all ABS-related grounds, especially at the controller. These systems often rely on both the controller ground and ECM ground as backup.\n\n3. Check the 4 ABS controller fuses - a visual inspection is quick and might save you time.\n\n4. Inspect the wheel speed sensors for broken wires - this is a common failure point.\n\n5. Try to communicate with the ABS controller to pull diagnostic trouble codes if possible.\n\n6. Test each speed sensor by measuring resistance (ohm reading).\n\n7. Check all power and ground connections at the controller (a halogen bulb test can be helpful).\n\n8. As a diagnostic step, you could run a jumper wire bypassing the suspect wire to see if that resolves the issue - this would confirm if you have a voltage drop on that specific line due to a partially damaged wire.\n\nThis methodical approach should help you isolate the problem before disassembling the dash unnecessarily.\n</ANSWER>"

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your symptoms, there are several potential causes for the overheating issue:\n\n1. **Radiator Flow Restriction**: This is highly likely given that the radiator cools off at idle while engine temp rises. Consider having the radiator removed and flow tested - it may have internal restrictions that aren't obvious.\n\n2. **Head Gasket Issue**: This is a known problem on these engines. Test for combustion gases in the cooling system using a CO2 tester. Even a small head gasket leak can cause these symptoms.\n\n3. **Coolant Mixture**: Check if your antifreeze is mixed too strong. Nearly pure antifreeze doesn't flow well at low speeds and transfers heat poorly.\n\n4. **Heater Core Restriction**: Try bypassing the heater core with clear hose to observe flow.\n\n5. **Radiator Obstruction**: Check between the radiator and condenser for debris blocking airflow.\n\n6. **Pump/Thermostat Installation**: Ensure proper clearance between pump impeller and block. Try removing the thermostat temporarily to check flow.\n\n7. **Temperature Sensor**: Verify the temp sensor is functioning correctly.\n\nSince you've already replaced the water pump and thermostat, I'd recommend:\n1. Test for combustion gases in coolant\n2. Have the radiator flow tested\n3. Check coolant mixture ratio\n\nThis pattern of overheating at idle but cooling when revved strongly suggests either a flow restriction or head gasket issue.\n</ANSWER>"

What type of issue are you having with the car that prompted the alternator replacement? Greg and crew\n\nWhat are the \"voltage drop\" readings of the circuit under load? This should identify the source of the condition.\n\nMike, You may not have as much of a problem as you think. As the other techs said, 12.5 volts at idle with several accessories on is normal. What I have found on many Audis is that there is a significant voltage drop on the positive wire to the battery under load. It sometimes has several connections with corresponding resistance. I usually add an additional wire directly from the B+ terminal on the alternator to the posotive terminal of the battery. One 10 guage wire will usually do the trick and insure good current feed to the battery. Route the wire so it doesn't interfere with anything. Hope this helps.\n\nI think you will find your problem in the PCM.As you know,when full power is demanded by the operator,the PCM detects this and shuts off any high demand power assessories including the battery charging so as to get full bhp from the engine.Your problem is,I think,that the PCM is regulating this feature at the wrong times and I think you should check this section out.\n\nCheck the voltage regulator, it might be faulty, I had a similiar problem. The alternator sounds like it works fine since it shows that it is putting out 14v at times, that is what the alternator should be putting out. The voltage regulator does just that, it regulates how much voltage the alternator is to put out, and it sounds like its shorting out when under a load, and its inexpensive, around $10.\n\nI don't know if this will help, but years ago in Phoenix, Arizona, we discovered that Audi Turbos would run down the battery in three hours or so in very hot weather. The problem was that the alternators did not have the amperage rating to supply enough currant when everything was running in hot conditions. At first, we sent the alternators out to be re-wound for higher amperage, then Audi supplied higher rated alternators. That fixed the problem.\n\nThis might sound stupid, but did you check how the serpentine belt is routed and is it the correct lenght.\n\neither the drive belt around the alternator is slipping or the alternator has a phase out or you have a voltage drop bettween the batt post on the alternator and the battery\n\nI am feeling as though the gentleman who suggested checking the p.c.m. is right. These systems are dependant on control via the p.c.m. and ought to be checked. The thing to do would be to find out what the volatages should be, when at an idle. If it's wrong, I would see about fault tracing the p.c.m.\n\nIf you install a new cluster on the early A6 it does have to be coded properly (4 or 6 cyl. etc.), but there are also some adaptations that have to be carried out. If these are not done you can have lots of problems.\n\nMike ,does the alternator pulley have the one way sprag on it? i have seen problems with these pulleys slipping in the past",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on the voltage readings you're providing (12.5V at idle with accessories on, 14V at higher RPM), this actually sounds like normal alternator behavior for your 2000 Audi A6 Quattro 2.7L.\n\nMost vehicles, including Audis, can struggle to maintain full charging voltage at idle when all accessories are running. The 120 amp alternator in your A6 simply can't produce its full output at idle speeds. This is why the voltage increases to 14V when you rev the engine - the alternator can then generate its full capacity.\n\nA few things to check:\n1. Inspect the serpentine belt for proper tension and routing\n2. Check for voltage drop between the alternator B+ terminal and the battery positive terminal under load\n3. Verify the alternator pulley isn't slipping (some have one-way sprag clutches that can fail)\n\nIf you're still concerned, you could add a supplemental 10-gauge wire directly from the alternator's B+ terminal to the battery positive terminal to reduce any voltage drop in the factory wiring.\n\nUnless you're experiencing other symptoms like a battery warning light or the battery dying overnight, this is likely normal operation rather than a defective alternator.\n</ANSWER>"

         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, there are several potential causes for the recurring caliper sticking issue:\n\n1. **Brake Booster/Master Cylinder Pushrod Adjustment**: The pushrod might be too long, causing constant slight pressure on the master cylinder. When the calipers start sticking again, try loosening the master cylinder nuts and pulling it away from the booster to see if the brakes release. If they do, adjust the pushrod or add washers between the master cylinder and booster.\n\n2. **Brake Pedal Return Issues**: Check if the brake pedal is fully returning. This could be related to:\n   - Improperly adjusted brake light switch\n   - Missing or incorrect rubber bumper that the pedal returns to\n   - Customer possibly \"two-footing\" while driving (resting foot on brake pedal)\n\n3. **ABS System Issues**: If the vehicle has ABS, there could be debris trapped in the ABS unit causing valves to stick open or closed. This is often caused by moisture in the system.\n\n4. **Fluid Contamination**: Check the master cylinder reservoir lid rubber for swelling, which would indicate petroleum contamination. If contaminated, you'll need to:\n   - Replace ALL brake components again (they're now \"infected\")\n   - Perform a denatured alcohol flush (not brake fluid)\n   - Replace all hoses, including rear ones\n\n5. **Metering/Proportioning Valve**: The metering valve assembly could be faulty, as seen in similar cases.\n\nSince the vehicle worked well during your test drives but failed after customer use, pay special attention to how the customer operates the vehicle and the brake pedal return system.\n</ANSWER>"

         "yours left balance shaft if balance shaft belt is istall properly the 2 arow(white mark ) will mett on the left side and the right side turn the balancer sproket 3 time by hand and fell the weigt inside when good position suposed to be and arrow by moving sloly clock wise and let go come back to the mark with the balance weigt install timing belt turn 2 time by hand and check timing note yours right side balancer will not be aligned turn 2 more time the crank and now it suposed to be aligned good luck\n\nlooking at the timing area of the engine the gear on the left that has the small belt is lined up with the mark in oil pump the gear on the right i have an easy way to set this up when you spin the balance shaft it will want to stop every 3 times it goes around it will almost want to line up with the mark you will spin it and will stop at the mark thats where you set it up it will only want to stop at the mark every 3rd time .\n\nHi Chris- Here's the information on lining up those balance shafts. By left shaft, I'm assuming you mean the shaft at the front of the car. When you line up the mark on the shaft pulley (at about 11 o'clock), don't worry about using the 6mm pin in the hole (the exhaust is usually in the way, anyways). When the mark is lined up, simply move the pulley slightly off the mark. If the balance weight is at the right spot, the shaft will try to move back to the index mark. If it tries to roll further away from the index, rotate the shaft one revolution, then repeat moving the shaft slightly off the mark; it will try to move back to the mark. The extra step in the timing marks is due to the gear ratio difference in the oil pump drive. The rear shaft is simply lined up with the mark (about 9 o'clock). Cams, crank are as in the manual. Also, don't forget to use www.hmaservice.comfor the factory manual information. Also, check to see the upper belt cover is updated; the new one will have a \"bump\" on the inside of the cover to help keep the belt from jumping time. You may also want to take a close look at the crank sensor and reluctor plate to see if there has been any contact. These have been a problem occasionally, with the CKP failing and the motor stops running. While the belt is off is the time to check it. Finally, check the TSB 03-20-002 for a crank bolt update. Some torque loss can allow the pulley, reluctor and sprocket to move around, wrecking the crank, reluctor and sprocket.\n\nChris, Richard nailed it. Make sure to replace the balance shaft belt and auto tensioner also, verify that the wiring for the crank sensor is tucked out of the way of the T-Belt to prevent rub through, and don't over-tighten the balance shaft belt. The balance shaft belt should have approximately 10mm of \"slack\". If it is too tight it will cause it to \"walk\" wearing it out very quickly and possibly causing severe damage. After it is all reassembled you will need to turn the motor over 6 times by hand for all of the marks to line back up correctly and verify correct timing. Good luck, these aren't too bad once you've done a few.\n\nChris, The balance shaft is driven at a 2:1 ratio through the oil pump. Simply remove the belt, rotate the oil pump gear one full turn and refit the belt. Screwdiver will now enter the hole. Regards, Brian",
         "<ANSWER>\nThe balance shaft alignment issue you're experiencing is normal for this engine. Here's how to properly align it:\n\nFor the left (front) balance shaft:\n1. Line up the dots on the oil pump as you've done\n2. For the left balance shaft, when you line up the mark on the shaft pulley (around 11 o'clock position), try moving the pulley slightly off the mark\n3. If the balance weight is correctly positioned, the shaft will naturally try to return to the index mark\n4. If it rolls away from the mark instead, rotate the shaft one full revolution and try again\n\nThis happens because the balance shaft is driven at a 2:1 ratio through the oil pump. If it's still not lining up, you can remove the belt, rotate the oil pump gear one full turn, and refit the belt.\n\nAdditional tips:\n- Replace the balance shaft belt and auto tensioner while you're in there\n- Ensure the balance shaft belt has about 10mm of \"slack\" (not too tight)\n- Check that the crank sensor wiring is tucked away from the timing belt\n- After reassembly, turn the motor over by hand 6 times to verify all marks line up correctly\n- Check TSB 03-20-002 for a crank bolt update\n- Look at the crank sensor and reluctor plate for any contact issues\n- Verify the upper belt cover is updated (should have a \"bump\" inside to prevent belt jumping)\n\nYou can also reference the factory manual at www.hmaservice.com for additional information.\n</ANSWER>"

         "Hi all. This car we have service for year, this problem has just started once the very cold weather here hit (Below freezing). The first inspection showed no visible signs of fuel leakage. We did find the service bulletin about fuel hoses leaking when cold. We discussed this with the customer that we could not confirm it would fix it, but he was willing to try it. We installed the kit for Subaru and returned the car. The customer stated that within a week (Once the below freezing temps returned) the car once again, on cold start up has a strong fuel smell in the car. We had the customer leave the car overnight, and we removed the rear seat to get at the fuel pump area. Once started, there are a strong burst of a gas smell, but I was unable to get any HC reading with my 4-gas. I mean, it read 00 HC and 0.0 CO. I ran the probe over the gas tank, the fuel cap and filler neck areas, the canister and the engine and fuel filter area's, 0. I talked with the customer about If the car was in a wreck, he stated that he bought this used, did a carfax check, as far as we can tell, no wrecks. In Oregon, we do not have self service, a gas attendant must fill your tank, I asked if he was topping or not, and he stated the he tells then not to top the tank. One last thing, the car is the sedan, not the station wagon model.",
         "Check it with a smoke machine if you have one.\n\nAny exhuast leaks? Smoke evap system.No mention of checking for codes,bad cat maybe.\n\ncheck all fuel hose clamps under the hood especially where hoses connect to rail. tighten all clamps.\n\nCheck REAL close at the fuel line conection at the left forward area of the fuel tank lines near the left rear suspention. The plastic \"quik-connects\" get goffy in the cold weather. It's where they go into the body.\n\nGo around and tighten all fuel line clamps.\n\nOk there really isnt a fix and its not the only car line out there suffering from it. but at temps I think around 18 degrees or colder with some moistuere in the air either when the temp hits this or before hand moisture freezes in the fuel tanks vent system. As a result the fuel vaoprs that are being moved around after start up as the tank vents which is actually quite a bit of expansion as the fuel lines start running around the engine and bring fuel temps up a lot. This Allows all of this to move out of the vent system without being filtered. I see a dozen of these every time we get below 20 degrees and its been moist out. One other place to check is any rubber fuel lines ( especially return lines) at the intake manifold I have heard of several leaking in cold weather. I had a Nissan in on Friday that had a very wet fuel line at the intake when I drove it in cold. After it warmed up the sweating went away. I put a new line on it.\n\nSounds like an evap issue. If you have a smoke machine, smoke it when it's cold. You may have a purge valve sticking closed not allowing it to vent.\n\nI have a 03 forester that my wife drives. we have the same problem with it. I have checked about everything you have and not found any thing no leaks or nothing. I am still looking and if i find the problem i will let you know. or if you find the problem let me know.\n\nI have been fighting this problem on my own car for 6 years. the only way I can beat it is by adjusting the fuel line clamps every year at the begining of winter. I have a few customers that I do the same thing on. I think it is a engine vibration/frequency problem that keeps loosing the clamps just enough and at zero deg cold start due to the different metal's and rubber expansions rates it creats a very slight seep for a few seconds. I am going to convert to all metal lines next year if I get time just for fun. but I have also heard the injector seals shrink also so who knows.\n\nHi Jeff, Very common on these cars.

The other common leak is by the fuel filter.",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, this is a common issue with Subarus in very cold weather. Here are the most likely causes and solutions:\n\n1. Fuel line clamps - The most common culprit. In cold weather, different expansion rates between metals and rubber can cause slight seepage. Check and tighten all fuel line clamps, especially:\n   - Near the fuel rail connections (particularly by #1 and #3 injectors)\n   - Under the hood where hoses connect to the rail\n   - At the fuel filter\n\n2. Plastic quick-connects - Examine the fuel line connections at the left forward area of the fuel tank near the left rear suspension. These plastic connectors often become problematic in cold weather.\n\n3. Short fuel lines - Look at the two short fuel lines on both sides of the engine in front of the injector rails. These can harden and crack in cold weather. Try wiggling or applying pressure to these lines after a cold start to see if they leak.\n\n4. Fuel tank vent system - At temperatures around 18°F or colder, moisture can freeze in the fuel tank's vent system. This prevents proper filtering of fuel vapors during the expansion that occurs after a cold start.\n\n5. EVAP system issues - Consider checking the purge valve, which might be sticking closed and not allowing proper venting.\n\n6. Filler neck - Check for small pin holes in the filler neck that might only be noticeable when cold.\n\nSome mechanics have solved similar issues by replacing the factory clamps with quality screw worm clamps. You might also want to check endwench.com archives for WRX fuel smell issues when cold.\n\nIf you can't find visible leaks, using a smoke machine when the vehicle is cold might help identify the source of the problem.\n</ANSWER>"

Head gasket has been leaking small amount of oil for past 30K, recently started showing signs of coolant leak(stain, crusty coolant). Customer was on fence on whether to fix or not so took car. 3 weeks later customer called and said temp gauge was 1 line from red. Vehicle came in and we verified low coolant and active leak from head gasket. Customer approve head gasket replacement. Had heads pressure tested and machined. Replaced head gaskets and thermostat as well as timing belt. Vehicle still has overheating concern, runs fine on highway, at slower speeds temp climbs steadily even with cooling fans both running. Shut down vehicle around 230-235 and allow to cool. Limp back to shop. Since this point we have: Performed chemical hydrocarbon test - negative results Replaced thermostat again with Subaru part Replaced radiator with new part Replace water pump Re-torqued head as recommended by our local machine shop Removed heads and replaced gaskets with Felpro head gasketsWhen we remove the new head gaskets the ring around cylinder #4 had a raised spot on both side like a small piece of debris was stuck between the layers so we thought for sure we had it fixed.We have tried both the Subaru bleeding procedure as well as an air-lift vacuum for the cooling system with no change.After each repair vehicle was road tested and same symptom every time. With vehicle in shop cooling fans come on at about 214-215 and go off at 208 after fully warmed up.We have never had this kind of problem with a Subaru before and are completely puzzled by why it is happening.Any and all help would be greatly apprieciated",
         "Some of my questions might be basic but not all info was provided so bear with me.Do cooling fans come on at specified temp,was water pump replaced?Do have adequate coolant flow in radiator[may be clogged].Is there hot and cool spots across radiator[check with infared temp gun],Coolant temp sensor also is switch for fans maybe that was compromised with initial overheating episode.Just some suggestions to lead you in right direction.\n\nHave you checked heater core for blockage?\n\nIt is likely that the original overheat caused silicate from the coolant to drop out and coat the inner surfaces of the radiator tubes. It is an excellent heat insulator and can only be removed by chemical bath. Most techs replace the radiator for this problem if it's Aluminum.Regards, Keith\n\nWe had same issue not long ago and found if you follow the cooling circuit on the vehicle (not info in Alldata), it must pass through the heater core for proper circulation. We replaced the heater core and everything was fine afterwards.\n\nI've had issues bleeding subaru cooling systems in the past. Lift just the front end up after warmed up. With vehicle off undo one of the heater hose clamps and let coolant run out a little. They get air pockets in the heater core\n\nDidn't see any mention of your pressure testing the cooling system. I'd also check the overflow hose for cracks, if it can expel fluid but can't suck it back in, in short order its low on coolant. Also recommend putting a new STANT cap on it and/or pressure testing the old one. Sounds stupid, but make sure fans are spinning correct direction. Subaru had a Yuuuge! problem getting head gaskets to seal and for awhile gave out tins of ground up walnut shells to put into the coolant. Hydrocarbon tests are iffy; the (blue, NAPA) reactant quickly goes bad ON THE SHELF. Need to test it with the C02 from your breath before using.\n\ntry bypassing the heater core as a test.just put the hoses together and see whay you get it could be the core.\n\nSubaru cooling system splits in two halves through the crossover pipe and must be filled from upper hose to avoid air pocket. Test the system with the thermostat removed to confirm the status .\n\nHello , What doesn't make sense to me is that its ok at highway speeds? That would indicate a airflow problem (plenty of air at highway speed). restriction problem should be worse at highway speeds. I guess make sure fans are running high speed and/or up to speed. One other thought is to check temperature difference head to head while its running hot with infrared Good LuckDaniel Salvatore\n\nHave you tried bypassing the heater core. From memory the bypass when thermostat is closed is via heater core\n\nchemical test is not accurate, use a gas analyzer instead. it is much,much accurate than chemical. next, hook the scan tool and compare it with the temperature gauge. sometime you have a false coolant sensor or sensor coated with sediment ot corrosion\n\nEven though you're getting what looks like a good flow of water through the heater core, it's very likely restricted. This is VERY common on the dual zone systems. The passenger side air will be noticeably cooler than the driver's side with the heat on. (As you described).\n\nsounds like a air pocket. try bleeding the system with the heater hose removed so you get all the air out.\n\nIt seems that by bypassing the heater core you have confirmed the diagnosis.Why then would it run hot at lower speeds but not on the highway? Perhaps the restriction in the core is such that at higher RPM, when the pump-discharge pressure increases, the core flow is sufficient.To test this theory, you could run the car in a lower gear at a road speed at which the car would run hot.\n\nThe smallest leak (in the heater core) will result in loss of system pressure. Perhaps it only leaks once it warms up. Suggest U Warm car up with radiator cap off and THEN pressure test it. Unpressurized coolant can boil, and the cooling system no longer works as designed. Result: Overheating. Once it's boiling, big pockets of water vapor DISPLACE coolant in the heater core, so you lose heat. It also forces coolant out into the overflow, and once THAT overflows, onto the ground. Out on the highway, where you don't see it. So now the system is underfilled. Have you got wet carpets, yukky coolant film on inside of windshield (from defrost), any indications of leaking heater core other than lack of heat?\n\nBecause the heater core circuit is vital to the proper flow of coolant in the system. Some vehicles do not have an issue with this, as the core circuit is an 'adjunct' to the system, and is not part of the total flow.To determine a core that is restricted is rather easy. Just measure the temp difference between the two hoses. There should be very little difference, just a few degrees. This signifies that all the tubes are open in the core. As more tubes become restricted, the flow is lessened, resulting in a reduced surface area for heat transfer, and the remaining tubes get too much transfer. The result is a cold core, because it has less internal volume.Example: original core has 200 tubes, and this is the designed surface area for maximum airflow, with good heat transfer. Half the tubes are plugged, resulting in much more heat loss for the open tubes, thus one hose colder than the other. Incidentally, you can also use this method for checking radiators.",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, it sounds like you're dealing with a heater core issue in your 2009 Subaru Outback. Several key points to consider:\n\n1. The symptom of overheating at slow speeds but running fine at highway speeds suggests an airflow or circulation problem rather than a head gasket issue.\n\n2. Since you've already replaced the head gaskets (twice), thermostat, radiator, and water pump with no improvement, the heater core is the most likely culprit.\n\n3. The heater core is a critical part of the Subaru cooling circuit - it's not just an \"add-on\" but an essential path for proper coolant circulation.\n\nTo diagnose and fix:\n\n1. Check the temperature difference between the two heater hoses - a significant difference indicates restriction.\n\n2. Try bypassing the heater core as a test - connect the hoses together and see if the overheating resolves.\n\n3. Look for signs of a leaking heater core: wet carpets, coolant film on windshield, or sweet smell from vents.\n\n4. The original overheating episode may have caused silicate from the coolant to drop out and create blockages in the heater core.\n\n5. Air pockets in the heater core are common in Subarus - try bleeding the system with the front end raised and one heater hose disconnected to release trapped air.\n\nMost likely you'll need to replace the heater core to fully resolve this issue. The restriction is probably allowing enough flow at highway speeds (higher pump pressure) but not at lower speeds.\n</ANSWER>"

         "Answer the following question after understanding the specifics of the vehicle in question.\n\nIt is a 2002 Toyota Prius 1.5L Caution light on. with the VIN JT2BK18U320042027 and a mileage of 121,123 mi. This 2002 Toyota Prius is a 1.5L / 4 cyl / Electric/Gas engine with Automatic Transaxle (Electronic) transmission.\nDelivery system: Fuel Injection / hybrid Emissions: OBD-II Compliant Symptoms: Caution Light On Issue occurs: Intermittently",
         "Vehicle comes in with complaint the orange caution light comes on vehicle drives normal. Ck codes none found. I test drove the car and could get it to act up only in ck mode using my Modis. It will act up caution light and main battery light comes on and a noticeable lose of power but sets no codes in the engine management or Hybrid systems. It doesn't seem to matter if the engine (Gas) is running or not. I do have Hybrid training from Toyota and we do a fair amount of prius work but this one is kicking my butt! Thanks in advance.",
         "Did a little research and seems there could be a problem with the high voltage battery. Not sure why your not getting any codes. Does it seem that that it only runs on the engine and not the high voltage battery? I suspect that it may need the battery. Hope this helps.\n\nThere must be codes. Try a different scanner? Without codes and accurate diagnostics it can be real expensive to guess. Could be a bunch of things, just need more information.\n\nHello John,The warning light will always be on if you put it in inspection mode.First I would check other modules for codes. If the triangle of death came on there has to be a code. Also check oil level and the 12V battery.Hope this helpsSeiko\n\nI have had a few with driveabilty problems after tbody work due to debris in the maf-make sure nothing fell onthe hot wire in the maf when you put it back together\n\nHey JohnAre we talking orange turtle light or the red triangle? Can you communicate with the HV battery ECU? If so, check datastream: if the PID for \"delta SOC\" is greater than 20%, the HV battery is degraded and will need to be replaced. The owner may choose to wait until the red triangle appears along with corresponding codes (P3006) but they should prepare for that to happen in the near future. If delta SOC is normal (20%), the turtle light is likely coming on b/c the HV battery is hot. Check the fan (left side of trunk area). What's the weather in NC these days? Any chance they've got a blanket or a pile of beanie babies over the inlet vent (shelf above rear seat)?Best of luck, c\n\nI use the SNAPON SOLUS ULTRA and I am able to go into modules other than ECM or TCM. It sounds like you may have a VSA (Vehicle Steering Angle) issue possibly. I wish I could plug into your Prius to confirm this. I had a vehicle like this the other day. I did the VSA reset by keeping the steering straight....being on perfectly level ground....and VSA resetting. The TRiangle with \"!\" in it disappeared and the steering angle was reset. THis usually is lost if there is a battery disconnect or a traction issue. I hope this helps. God bless.\n\nThere have been some good suggestions so far John. I would add that you should check the oil level. I had a customer with significantly higher mileage (250k) and she never checked the oil level and was always well over normal service interval. The warning would come up in the infotainment screen along with the beeping, but only for 1 second while going around a corner. Turned out out to have 1 quart or less of engine oil.\n\nSurprised you don't have any codes. Those HV battery voltages don't move much by the way. They typically stay about the same voltage from 30-60% SOC. If you were suspicious about the battery, take a movie with the scanner and go load the battery; floor it going uphill or something. If random modules start dropping off on accel or spike high when braking hard, there's a problem. Oh yea, you could check the ABS controller for HV related codes too. I agree with C about the possible overheating. Clear the beanie baby shelf and check the ducting; possible mouse nest?\n\nPlease be specific. Please describe the exact appearance of the lamp in question.\n\ni agree with most of the replies need to know which light is comming on also if you would have a hv battery going south on you you would have supporting codes also sometimes not being able to get any codes from one or more system only means that that system is off line it can still cause problems and you just cant read it, an easy way to check that is look for data in any of the systems you are checking for codes if you can get data you can get codes if there is none then there is none, on that vintage the steering angle reset may or may not set a code it is easy to do so do it to rule it out even if you had an mg2 problem you should have a code for it however if the problem is mechanical then no code will show all the trany is , is two motors with final drive and planetary unsles it causes a short in the motor windings no code also you could drain the oil in the trans and look for stuff that does not belong therethese are just thoughts based on your info\n\nIf you have red triangle,you have a fault code. A problem in a number of systems can set the main warning light. Must do a scan on every system abs and so on. Check h/v cooling fan for fluf and check h/v temp , if h/v battery over heats it can drop power. A quick check is if the fan is on strong(hear it at the rear seat).or the h/v cooling sys pump will do same, does the A/c shut down when faulting.hopefully this small 2 cents can help.....you need codes...",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, there are several potential issues to investigate with your 2002 Prius showing the caution light and power loss without setting codes:\n\n1. First, clarify which warning light you're seeing - the orange turtle light or red triangle? This distinction matters for diagnosis.\n\n2. Check the high voltage battery:\n   - Use your scan tool to check the \"delta SOC\" parameter - if it's greater than 20%, the HV battery is degraded and likely needs replacement\n   - Verify the HV battery cooling system is working properly - check the fan on the left side of the trunk area and ensure the inlet vent above the rear seat isn't blocked\n\n3. Check other modules for codes:\n   - The warning light will always be on in inspection mode\n   - Try scanning all modules (not just engine/hybrid) including ABS for HV-related codes\n   - If you can't communicate with certain modules, they may be offline which itself indicates a problem\n\n4. Additional checks:\n   - Verify engine oil level is correct (low oil can trigger warnings)\n   - Check the 12V battery condition\n   - Consider performing a Vehicle Steering Angle (VSA) reset\n   - Inspect the MAF sensor for debris if you've done throttle body work\n   - Check transaxle fluid for contamination\n\n5. Test under load conditions:\n   - Record data while driving uphill with heavy acceleration\n   - Watch for modules dropping offline during acceleration or spiking during braking\n\nIt's unusual to have no codes with these symptoms, so either there's a mechanical issue or you need to look in less obvious modules for the fault codes.\n</ANSWER>"

         "Answer the following question after understanding the specifics of the vehicle in question.\n\nIt is a 1992 Saab 9000 Turbo 2.3L Engine. with the VIN YS3CL55M7N1022049 and a mileage of 185,972 mi. This 1992 Saab 9000 Turbo is a 2.3L / 4 cyl / Gas engine with 5-speed Standard Transaxle transmission.\nDelivery system: Fuel Injection Affected component: Engine Conditions: Smokes Badly",
         "This Saab was driving down the road when it started smoking profusely. Was so bad customer had the car towed in. We confirmed the smoke was engine oil by it's color and smell. When the car is started cold there is no smoke until it starts to warm up. If you then rev the engine a couple times it will put out smoke and continue to smoke as long as you let it idle. And it's a lot. At a steady 1500 rpm I thought the fire dept might be stopping by as you could hardly see my building. Removed spark plugs which all were clean. Looked at pistons with bore scope and they are all clean and evenly lightly coated with brown carbon. Removed exhaust pipe at turbo and hoses at inner cooler. All is dry there, ruling out a turbo failure. We ran the car for about a half hour hoping oil fouling would show up but when we pulled the plugs all still looks clean in spite of the smoking. Took off the valve cover and looked at the valve seals which looked intact. Checked crank case pressure which is acceptable and the PCV is sucking what feels to be about the right amount of air volume. There is no oil leaking down the hose which goes back to the air boot at the turbo inlet. Oil level is correct and clean by the way. So we decided to take off the head and inspect the valve guides closer as something obviously broke and changed from all ok to smoking in a moments time. While taking off the head we noticed oil in the intake manifold, heavier on #3 runner where the PCV sucks it's vacuum from directly above it. Which brings us back to the breather but what? There is a baffle in the valve cover which is intact and appears to be there to stop oil from going into the inlet of the pcv fitting. With the Fitting out of the valve cover and the engine running it isn't spitting any oil out. Just a little blow by but not excessive. Well by the time we saw the intake the head was almost off so we finished removing it and found everything to be pretty nice, including newer valve stem seals. The head looks like it has been off within the last few years even though our cust has only had this car six months. I wish now we had run the car much longer with the PCV out of the VC to see if the smoking was less but hindsight is 20-20. We are replacing the VS seals and putting the head back on now, convinced the problem lies elsewhere, but where?Does this scenario ring a bell with any of you Saab guys?We are totally baffled at this point.Thanks",
         "check for a restriction at the air inlet to the filter housing. this can cause a vacuum to be drawn in the air intake boot and may suck oil in through the breather Try running it with the air filter housing open and see if it still smokes.\n\nIt's almost always the turbo. It can leak oil into the intake, or into the exhaust. Just because you don't see oil on the exhaust side, doesn't mean the oil isn't leaking into the intake. The amount of smoke, and the rapid onset of the problem, are pretty classic symptoms. Good luck, Dave\n\nIt has been awhile but, there is a black plastic box in the PCV system that has some sort of valve in it that goes bad and allows oil to be sucked up and burned. Call the SAAB dealer, it is a common fault and they stock them.\n\nhas anybody checked the pcv valve? if it allows turbo pressure thru it will suck oil into the intake\n\ntwo things can happen one is the turbo. pop off the intake tube and wiggel the shaft if it is loose that is your issue two pull all the plugs is #1 cyl wet the others dry? the head gasket breaks bettween the timing chain galley and the # 1 cyl. on the intake stroke it pulss oil in sortt wants to go back to its two stroke roots good luck\n\nIts the TURBO. The oil seal on the exhaust side is bad leaking oil directly into the exhaust, Very common. If the engine was burning that much it would foul the spark plugs. Put the head back on and replace the turbo.\n\nstill think it is the turbo, did you check the intercooler for oil?\n\nfirst of all, did you check for impeller play when you dropped the headpuipe? It still sounds like turbo...The only other thing with the pcv is if the vacuum check valve is blown out- one way check valve to stop pressureizing the crankcase under boost- in the vacuum purge line. Also, what does the bore look like in #3?- possibly rings?\n\nSure sounds like the turbo has failed and is allowing oil to enter the exhaust causing the smoke.\n\nIt doesn't take much oil getting past the turbine seals to make a lot of smoke, and if it leaks into the exhaust side there will be little or no evidence in the engine, the heat in the turbo and catalytic converter burns it all. Time for a turbo.\n\nreplace turbo. one time i had one in my shop like that i sent my tech out in it to ck it. he went up on the freeway witch i can see from my desk and it stopped traffic up there in both directions. by the time he got to an exit and turned around and got back here, there was a chp helicopter buzzing our building. he had followed him back. we have changed many saab turbos for this problem its leaking oil on the exhaust side and taking directly to a hot cat. good luck\n\nsounds like a bad turbo, maybe a leak at he head gasket or a broken piston, Did you do a leak down test?\n\nsounds like turbo leaking into exhaust,some exhaust manifolds have a screw in plug between head and turbo, at times when not sure I have removed the plug and no smoke from engine but lots of smoke out the exhaust so changed the turbo...hth jerry",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on the symptoms you're describing, this is almost certainly a failing turbo. Here's why:\n\n1. The sudden onset of heavy smoke is a classic turbo failure symptom\n2. The fact that it smokes worse when warm and when revved points to the turbo\n3. Clean spark plugs despite heavy smoking suggests the oil isn't entering through the combustion chamber\n4. The oil you found in the intake manifold is another strong indicator\n\nEven though you didn't see oil at the turbo exhaust connection, it doesn't mean the turbo isn't leaking. Oil can leak into the exhaust side and be completely burned off by the time it reaches where you checked. It only takes a small amount of oil past the turbine seals to create massive smoke.\n\nSeveral things to check:\n- Check for play in the turbo shaft/impeller\n- Inspect the intercooler for oil contamination\n- Look at the PCV system, particularly the check valve that prevents boost pressure from pushing oil into the intake\n- Verify the air filter housing isn't restricted (can create vacuum that pulls oil in)\n\nI'd recommend replacing the turbo before reassembling everything. This is a very common issue with these Saabs, and the symptoms match perfectly. The oil is likely leaking on the exhaust side and going straight to the hot catalytic converter, creating the massive smoke you're seeing.\n</ANSWER>"

Replaced cam sensor (OEM), cleared all codes, and car has been fine until a few days ago when it came back with the listed codes.Car will run alright for up to a couple of miles, and then will lose all power and is barely driveable. As you apply the gas it will start to accelerate and then cut out.I've read the service bulletin SI B 12 07 99, which leads me to beleive the electronic throttle (MDK) is at fault. Just wondering if there are any other tests that can be performed to verify that the electronic throttle is at fault before I take that plunge. Harness connector at throttle looks ok, although I have not had time to check the harness for continuity yet.TIA,Jeff",
         "I had a fun one last month, same type car came in and had 0 power and died.

What about fuel pressure during the cut-out, what is it at? Have you sweeped the throttle position sensor on a DSO? Look at the oxygen sensors too, if they're aging, this will cause a problem. They should have been replaced at 100K as recommended by dealer. Fuel filter may be clogged, I've seen that on these as well, good luck, let us know what you find",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your symptoms with the 2000 BMW 528i, there are several potential causes to investigate:\n\n1. MDK Electronic Throttle Assembly - This is likely the culprit based on the service bulletin SI B 12 07 99 you mentioned. Many techs recommend simply replacing the entire assembly as the proper fix. Some have had temporary success cleaning the potentiometer's sweeper arm, but replacement is the recommended permanent solution.\n\n2. Fuel System Issues - Check if there's any damage to the passenger side fuel tank, as this could affect the fuel pump module. A broken plastic component inside the tank could cause your symptoms.\n\n3. Additional checks to perform before replacing the throttle:\n   - Check the pedal travel sensor\n   - Measure fuel pressure during the cut-out episodes\n   - Use a DSO (Digital Storage Oscilloscope) to sweep the throttle position sensor\n   - Inspect oxygen sensors (should have been replaced at 100K miles)\n   - Check if the fuel filter is clogged\n\nI'd recommend scanning for fault codes again and performing these diagnostic steps to confirm the electronic throttle is indeed the problem before replacement. The intermittent nature of your issue is classic for a failing throttle assembly in these BMWs.\n</ANSWER>"

         "Customer brought car in to check for a one time no crank no start do to a discharged battery. She thought she might have left something on and the problem has not reoccured. The battery was relatively new, was charged and tested fine. We only got 13.6 volts at the battery. The key off draw was 250 ma even after 2 hours. It goes below 10 ma with the LIN wire unplugged from the alternator. There are CAN comunication codes for communication with the alternator and battery monitoring control module J367. The VAS5052 walked us through a simple test. With J367 unplugged there was still no communication to the alternator. With the alternator LIN plug disconnected there is communication with J367. The 5052 advised us to replace the alternator once we confiirmed the LIN wire was not open or shorted to ground or positive. Easier said than done. The Audi part number on the alternator is not what ETKA calls for. We confirmed this with the dealer. Our car has plug for the LIN connector. The called for alternator has an eyelet connector. For price reasons we opted for a new Valeo as opposed to a factory Audi unit. The draw is down to 80 mamp but the codes are still present and the test procedure condemns the alternator again. WTF!",
         "its common on vw/audi for the alternator to draw current and kill battery, just replace the alternator..\n\nreplace alternator ,draw is to high\n\n80 m amps is too high - quiscent current should not be over 50m amps after all modules have gone to sleep mode - takes around 50mnts with all functions closed & doors, bonnet, trunk lid closed - the car has an alternator with a LIN line and this is also a giving out a signal - since this is now not being received from the new alternator that you have installed the LIN will not go into sleep mode and will keep hunting for the signal - check ETKA again via the F1 function with full VIN no - if still does not display the correct part no then use the PR conditions to choose the right part or send a feedback mail via ETKA they will give you the correct part - raise the ticket on this VIN with attachment of freeze frame data highlighting the part required\n\nwith the low mileage and the fact that the wrong alternator was installed and the non correct battery i would advise your customer the cost to restore the car to the correct battery and alternator and then see what the issue is most likely a bad alternator to begin with these people buy these and think they are cheap to fix get a can test box and see if all the networks are going to sleep after an hour if you put a less expensive alternator in you are looking at a come back vehicle\n\nId agree with all the statements above. These vehicles reqire the correct parts installed for them not to have any issues. Sometimes even the oem part is the only way to go. As far as coding the battery to the vehicle this is a vital part in Audi VW Porsche battery replacment. The battery manager used the info from the battery to detmin faulty battery, current draw, etc... say you just went ahead and replaced the battery due to being dead and never coded it to the vehicle... the battery manager would never know the difference and the vehicle may continue to no respond correctly. If you have a oe scan tool or similar then you should be able to code the battery thru 19 module. If you are unsure of any of this id recommend a visit to the dealer. Good luck and keep us updated.\n\nyou can make up a serial number it has to be 10 digits,and not the same as the old one,to start with\n\nIf you do not do it, then ecu will not know capacity in Ah, or not updated counters, or charge state. Car should run, it may result in under charge or overcharge battery, if the Ah (ampere hour) capacity is different. Pleae go to Ross tech web site for coding instructions.\n\nYou should be able to get a Bosch reman alternator for not too much more than the El Cheapo. I show them for $229. As for the serial number...I don't see any way to do this other than find and Audi battery of the same rating and use that serial number.\n\nJust went with the same issue with my current shop for a z4 and lin bus fault post alt replacement.. i dont like valeo and bosh components rather have dealer parts..yesterday i had a faulty new starter from bosh it blew fuse for cas(bmw) what a head acheSent from Yahoo Mail on Android",
         "<ANSWER>\nBased on your description, you're dealing with a common VW/Audi issue where the alternator draws excessive current and drains the battery. The 80mA draw you're measuring is still too high - quiescent current should be under 50mA after all modules go to sleep (which takes about 50 minutes with everything closed).\n\nThe key issue here is that your vehicle uses an alternator with a LIN communication line. Since the replacement Valeo alternator isn't communicating properly with the system, the LIN module won't go into sleep mode and keeps searching for a signal, causing the excessive draw.\n\nYou need to install the correct OEM alternator for this vehicle. Double-check ETKA using the F1 function with the full VIN, or use the PR conditions to identify the right part. If still unclear, send a feedback request through ETKA with freeze frame data.\n\nFor these vehicles, using the exact correct parts is critical - sometimes only OEM will work properly. A Bosch remanufactured alternator (around $229) would be a better option than the Valeo if you want to avoid dealer pricing.\n\nAlso, ensure the battery is properly coded to the vehicle through module 19. Without proper coding, the battery management system won't function correctly, potentially causing charging issues.\n\nI'd recommend getting the correct alternator with the proper LIN connector configuration. Otherwise, you're likely looking at a comeback vehicle with persistent issues.\n</ANSWER>"

       "\n",
       "5. **Test for Power**: Use a multimeter to test for power at the identified pins when the central locking system is activated. You should see voltage if the system is functioning correctly.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Check Grounds**: Ensure all grounds related to the central locking system are clean and secure. A faulty ground can prevent the system from working.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Test Communication**: If power is present, test the communication between the central locking module and the actuators (rear door locks and gas door). This may involve using a scan tool or monitoring voltage changes at the actuators when the locks are activated.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **Replace the Module**: If all tests indicate the module is faulty, replace it with a new one. Ensure it's programmed correctly for your vehicle.\n",

Since all fuses are good, we can focus on the Central Locking Module (CLM) in the dash. Here's a strategy for pin testing:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Preparation:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Consult your repair manual or a wiring diagram specific to your vehicle (VIN WBAGJ8325VDL40880) to identify the CLM location, pinout, and wiring colors.\n",
       "2. Ensure you have a multimeter and a wiring diagram to help with the testing process.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 1: Identify the CLM Connector**\n",
       "\n",
       "Locate the CLM in the dash and identify the connector. It's usually a 32-pin or 40-pin connector, depending on the model year and configuration. Consult your wiring diagram to confirm the connector type and pinout.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 2: Pin Testing**\n",
       "\n",
       "Using your multimeter, perform the following tests:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Power supply:** Measure the voltage at the CLM connector pins that supply power to the module (usually pins 1, 2, or 3). You should read around 12V with the ignition switch in the \"ON\" position.\n",
       "2. **Ground:** Verify the ground connection at the CLM connector (usually pins 4, 5, or 6). You should read 0V or very close to 0V with the multimeter set to DC volts.\n",
       "3. **Communication lines:** Identify the pins responsible for communication between the CLM and the Assenmacher Retriever (usually pins 10, 11, or 12). Measure the voltage on these pins with the ignition switch in the \"ON\" position. You should read a voltage signal (around 5V or 12V) indicating communication activity.\n",
       "4. **Output signals:** Measure the voltage on the pins that control the rear door locks and gas door (usually pins 20, 21, or 22). You should read a voltage signal (around 12V) when the central locking system is activated.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 3: Analyze Results**\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on your test results, you can start to identify the problem:\n",
       "\n",

       "Considering the symptoms you've described, I'd like to focus on a few potential causes:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Air in the cooling system**: Although you've tried bleeding the system using the Subaru procedure and an air-lift vacuum, I'd recommend trying a more aggressive approach. You can try using a cooling system vacuum pump to remove any air pockets that might be trapped in the system. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions and take necessary precautions.\n",
       "2. **Cylinder head or engine block issue**: The raised spot on the ring around cylinder #4 could be a sign of a more significant problem. I'd recommend performing a leak-down test or a compression test to identify any potential issues with the cylinder head or engine block. This might help you pinpoint the source of the problem.\n",
       "3. **Cooling fan operation**: You mentioned that the cooling fans come on at around 214-215°F and go off at 208°F. This seems like a normal operating range. However, I'd like to suggest checking the fan wiring and relay to ensure they're functioning correctly. You can also try swapping the fan relay with a known good one to rule out any electrical issues.\n",
       "4. **Radiator hoses and connections**: Double-check the radiator hoses and connections for any signs of leakage or blockage. Make sure they're securely connected and not restricting coolant flow.\n",
       "5. **Engine management system**: Although you've mentioned that the vehicle runs fine on the highway, I'd like to suggest checking the engine management system for any trouble codes or issues.

       "To diagnose and fix:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Check the temperature difference between the two heater hoses - a significant difference indicates restriction.\n",

This is usually located behind the glove box or under the steering column.\n\n3. **Access the Module**: Remove any trim or panels necessary to access the module. Be careful not to damage any wiring or components.\n\n4. **Identify the Pins**: Using your wiring diagram, identify the pins related to the rear door locks and gas door. These are typically part of a larger connector.\n\n5. **Test for Power**: Use a multimeter to test for power at the identified pins when the central locking system is activated. You should see voltage if the system is functioning correctly.\n\n6. **Check Grounds**: Ensure all grounds related to the central locking system are clean and secure. A faulty ground can prevent the system from working.\n\n7. **Test Communication**: If power is present, test the communication between the central locking module and the actuators (rear door locks and gas door). This may involve using a scan tool or monitoring voltage changes at the actuators when the locks are activated.\n\n8. **Replace the Module**: If all tests indicate the module is faulty, replace it with a new one. Ensure it's programmed correctly for your vehicle.\n\n9. **Reassemble**: Once repairs are made, reassemble everything in reverse order of how it was disassembled.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and potentially fix the issue with your central locking system.",
         "To tackle the issue with the central locking system on your 1997 BMW 740iL, we'll need to follow a step-by-step approach to identify the problem. Since all fuses are good, we can focus on the Central Locking Module (CLM) in the dash. Here's a strategy for pin testing:\n\n**Preparation:**\n\n1. Consult your repair manual or a wiring diagram specific to your vehicle (VIN WBAGJ8325VDL40880) to identify the CLM location, pinout, and wiring colors.\n2. Ensure you have a multimeter and a wiring diagram to help with the testing process.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the CLM Connector**\n\nLocate the CLM in the dash and identify the connector. It's usually a 32-pin or 40-pin connector, depending on the model year and configuration. Consult your wiring diagram to confirm the connector type and pinout.\n\n**Step 2: Pin Testing**\n\nUsing your multimeter, perform the following tests:\n\n1. **Power supply:** Measure the voltage at the CLM connector pins that supply power to the module (usually pins 1, 2, or 3). You should read around 12V with the ignition switch in the \"ON\" position.\n2. **Ground:** Verify the ground connection at the CLM connector (usually pins 4, 5, or 6). You should read 0V or very close to 0V with the multimeter set to DC volts.\n3. **Communication lines:** Identify the pins responsible for communication between the CLM and the Assenmacher Retriever (usually pins 10, 11, or 12). Measure the voltage on these pins with the ignition switch in the \"ON\" position. You should read a voltage signal (around 5V or 12V) indicating communication activity.\n4. **Output signals:** Measure the voltage on the pins that control the rear door locks and gas door (usually pins 20, 21, or 22). You should read a voltage signal (around 12V) when the central locking system is activated.\n\n**Step 3: Analyze Results**\n\nBased on your test results, you can start to identify the problem:\n\n* If you don't read any voltage on the power supply pins, check the wiring and fuses again.\n* If the ground connection is faulty, repair or replace the ground wire.\n* If the communication lines show no activity, check the wiring and connections between the CLM and the Assenmacher Retriever.\n* If the output signals are not present, the issue might be with the CLM or the wiring to the rear door locks and gas door.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nBased on your findings, you may need to:\n\n* Consult a BMW specialist or a professional mechanic for further assistance.\n* Replace the CLM or repair the wiring and connections.\n* Perform additional tests to isolate the problem.\n\nRemember to always follow proper safety procedures when working with electrical systems, and consult your repair manual or a wiring diagram specific to your vehicle to ensure accurate information.",
         "Based on your symptoms with the rear door locks and gas door not operating, here are some troubleshooting steps to follow:\n\n1. First, check the fuses in the trunk near the battery. The fuel door actuator often blows a fuse when it fails, which can disable multiple central locking functions. When checking fuses, be careful as these blade-type fuses can sometimes crack rather than completely blow, giving false readings during testing.\n\n2. Try disconnecting the gas door actuator and recheck the system. Failed fuel door actuators are known to cause system issues.\n\n3. Perform a system reset by disconnecting the battery cables and touching them together through a 10 ohm, one watt resistor for a few minutes, then reconnect.\n\n4. If you need to test the General Module (body control unit) directly, the lock signals for the rear doors and gas door are on pins 13 (black wire, approx. 12 gauge) and 14 (blue wire, 12 gauge) of the large connector. These signals toggle between lock/unlock. The GM is located behind the glove box.\n\n5. Try removing the central lock fuse to see if doors will open manually.\n\n6. Check if unlocking through the trunk with the key affects just the front doors or all doors - this can help diagnose where the issue lies.\n\nIf communication with the Assenmacher retriever still fails after these steps and you can communicate with other systems, the General Module itself may be faulty.",

Verify fuel pressure readings - what were the pressure numbers before changing the pump?\n\n3. Consider checking for exhaust restrictions:\n   - Remove upper O2 sensors to see if providing an exhaust path helps\n   - Check for plugged catalytic converters\n\n4. Since you have spark and fuel delivery but it won't run:\n   - Check for large vacuum leaks\n   - Verify EGR isn't stuck open\n   - Check MAF and camshaft position sensor readings\n   - Verify compression (fuel-fouled plugs could be washing down cylinders)\n\n5.

Restricted radiator - With 110K miles, the radiator tubes could be 50% or more plugged. Have the radiator flow checked or take it to a radiator shop to have the tubes inspected/rodded out.\n\n2. Fan clutch issues - Check if the fan clutch is engaging properly. A failing fan clutch won't provide adequate airflow at lower speeds.\n\n3. Possible blockage in the cooling system - Check for debris or matting of materials in front of the radiator behind the condenser.\n\n4. Potential cracked heads - Even though the heads were replaced, there could be cracks that weren't visible during machining. These can cause the same symptoms as a blown head gasket.\n\nI'd start with having the radiator flow checked since that's the most common cause of overheating after all the work you've done. Also check the temperature difference between the two radiator hoses when overheating - if they're significantly different, it confirms a restriction in the radiator or a defective thermostat.",

         "Based on your description, here are a few potential causes for the noise:\n\n1. **Lifter Noise**: Although you've checked valve clearance, it's worth re-examining, especially since these are shimmed tappets. Sometimes, the noise can be misleading, and it might not be coming from where you think.\n\n2. **PCV System**: Ensure the PCV system is functioning correctly. A clogged PCV valve or hose can cause oil to enter the combustion chamber, leading to noise.\n\n3. **Oil Control Rings**: If the engine had low oil pressure or was overheated, the oil control rings might be stuck, causing noise.\n\n4. **Piston Slap**: This is common in engines with aluminum blocks and steel sleeves. It's more noticeable when cold and usually goes away when warm.\n\n5. **Wrist Pin Noise**: Although you think it sounds too light, it's worth investigating further. Look for any signs of wrist pin issues.\n\n6. **Crankshaft or Camshaft**: Rare, but possible. Check for any unusual wear or damage.\n\n7. **Oil Pump**: Ensure it's functioning correctly. Low oil pressure can cause various noises.\n\n8. **Valve Train**: Check for any bent valves or rocker arms.\n\n9. **Piston Skirt Clearance**: If the pistons are hitting the cylinder walls, it could cause noise.\n\n10. **Cylinder Wall Damage**: Overheating can cause cylinder wall damage, leading to noise.\n\nBefore proceeding, it might be helpful to get a compression test done to identify any issues with the cylinders.",

You might want to try re-shimming the tappets or replacing them if necessary.\n2. **Wrist pin or piston issue**: Although you mentioned it sounds too light for a wrist pin issue, it's still worth investigating. The 4.7L V8 engine in your Lexus GX470 is known to have some issues with wrist pin wear. You might want to perform a compression test or leak-down test to rule out any internal engine problems.\n3. **PCV system issue**: The Positive Crankcase Ventilation (PCV) system can cause strange noises, especially if it's clogged or not functioning properly. Make sure the PCV valve is clean and functioning correctly.\n4. **Oil pressure issue**: Low oil pressure can cause lifter noise or other engine noises. Check the oil pressure gauge to ensure it's within the recommended range.\n5. **Engine mechanical issue**: It's possible that the used engine had a pre-existing condition that wasn't apparent when it was installed.

Since the 2007 GX470 doesn't use hydraulic lifters but shimmed tappets, here are some possibilities:\n\n1. Check valve clearances while cold - improper clearance can cause ticking noises that sound like lifter problems.\n\n2. Inspect the VVT-i system - this could be causing the noise if there's an issue with the cam gear.\n\n3. Examine the camshaft scissor gear alignment - these should be properly aligned with a bolt holding them during installation.\n\n4. Look for foreign objects - something may have been dropped down the intake port or gotten into the valve train.\n\n5. Check for damaged valve keepers - there have been cases where these engines had valve keeper issues without dropping valves.\n\n6. Pull the valve cover and run the engine briefly to visually inspect the valve train operation.\n\n7. Consider checking the oil pan for bearing material - sometimes what sounds like top-end noise in Toyota aluminum engines can actually be bottom-end related.\n\n8. Try changing oil viscosity temporarily as a diagnostic test - if the noise changes, it may help pinpoint the cause.\n\nSince the salvage yard claims it was quiet when it left, document your findings thoroughly before proceeding.

Check the FPR: Look for the FPR, which is usually located on the driver's side of the engine compartment. It might be connected to the intake manifold or the fuel rail. If you find it, check if there's a vacuum port that matches the diameter of the missing hose.\n2. Check the IAC valve: The IAC valve is usually located on the intake manifold or the throttle body. It might have a vacuum port that matches the missing hose.\n3. Check the Brake Booster Vacuum Port: The brake booster is usually located on the driver's side of the engine compartment. It might have a vacuum port that matches the missing hose.\n\nTo help you further, I'd recommend checking the following resources:\n\n* The Saab 9000 repair manual (available online or at your local library)\n* The Saab 9000 technical service bulletin (TSB) database (available online)\n* Online forums and communities dedicated to Saab 9000 owners (like this one!)\n\nIf you're still stuck, feel free to provide more information or clarification on what you've found so far, and I'll do my best to help you track down the missing vacuum line.",
         "Based on your description, it sounds like you're dealing with a vacuum line routing issue on your 1995 Saab 9000 CSE Turbo. The mystery line with the tee connection is most likely the boost gauge line.\n\nThe routing should be:\n1. One end connects to the intake\n2. Then runs to the air bypass valve for the turbo on the air inlet ducting\n3. There's a tee in the line\n4. The third end (the one you can't locate) most likely goes through the firewall to connect to the boost gauge on your dashboard\n\nLook for a white plastic nipple on the firewall just to the left of the heater box, under the wiper linkage and cowl cover. This connection point can be difficult to find. The line passes through the firewall in the area between the heater hoses.\n\nIf your boost gauge isn't working, this is likely your issue. The vacuum line feeds pressure data to the gauge and possibly to an overpressure transducer.\n\nIf you need a visual reference, the Saab parts catalog has diagrams that show this routing clearly. The routing may also vary depending on whether your car has the Electronic Throttle System/Traction Control System (ETS/TCS).",

However, given that grounding the wire doesn't turn on any lights on the instrument panel and disconnecting it doesn't affect any gauges, it's possible that it's not the primary OPS.\n\nAnother possibility is that it's a Oil Pressure Switch (OPS) or a Low Oil Pressure Switch. These switches are designed to trigger a warning light on the instrument panel when the oil pressure drops below a certain threshold. However, since grounding the wire doesn't turn on any lights, it's possible that this switch is not connected to the instrument panel.\n\nI'd like to suggest a few things to help narrow down the possibilities:\n\n1. Check the wiring diagram for your vehicle to see if it shows a sensor or switch connected to the oil passage in the location you described.\n2. Use a multimeter to measure the resistance of the sensor. This might give us a clue about what type of sensor it is.\n3.

         "Based on your symptoms with the 1997 Saab 900 SE Turbo, this sounds like a classic ignition switch failure. Here's what I'd recommend:\n\n1. Check the ignition switch - The 97-98 900s have the \"old\" style switch (part #4409553) which is a common failure point. When these fail, they can cause intermittent power interruptions to various control modules, explaining why you're getting warning lights but no stored codes. If it has the old part number, replacing it with the newer version (4946307) might solve your issues.\n\n2. Check power/ground connections - When no codes are logged despite warning lights, it's often because power or ground to the ECU was interrupted. Inspect battery cables, posts, and ground connections for corrosion or looseness.\n\n3. Check voltage readings - Try monitoring voltage readings on the Tech 2 under read values/activate of the ABS system. If you see fluctuating voltage (around 10V), this further points to the ignition switch.\n\n4. Try Generic OBDII mode - Sometimes codes only show up in Generic OBDII mode rather than the Saab-specific diagnostics.\n\nThe fact that you're seeing both transmission and ABS warning lights with no stored codes strongly suggests an electrical supply issue rather than actual component failures.

You may want to try disconnecting the BCM connector and see if the draw disappears.\n3. **Short circuit in the wiring harness**: Although you've checked the wiring harnesses and found no damaged or shorted wires, it's still possible that there's a short circuit somewhere in the system. You may want to try using a wiring diagram to identify potential short circuits and inspect the wiring more closely.\n4. **Faulty relay or module**: It's possible that one of the relays or modules in the system is not fully shutting down when the vehicle is turned off, causing the parasitic drain.

The FICM is responsible for controlling the fuel injectors, and a faulty FICM can cause a range of issues, including overfueling, misfires, and excessive emissions.\n\nTo test the FICM output and control to injectors, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Scan tool testing**: Use a scan tool (such as a Tech2 or a high-end code reader) to monitor the FICM's output to the injectors. Look for any unusual patterns or codes that may indicate a problem with the FICM.\n2. **Injector pulse width testing**: Use a multimeter to measure the injector pulse width (IPW) on each injector. Compare the readings to the manufacturer's specifications. If the IPW is outside the specified range, it could indicate a problem with the FICM.\n3. **FICM voltage testing**: Measure the voltage output from the FICM to each injector. The voltage should be within the specified range (usually around 48-50V). If the voltage is low or erratic, it could indicate a problem with the FICM.\n4. **Swap FICM with a known good unit**: If possible, try swapping the FICM with a known good unit to see if the problem persists. This can help determine if the issue is indeed with the FICM.\n\nRegarding the symptoms you've described:\n\n* The fuel knock on cylinder #1 that disappears when disabled suggests a problem with the injector or the FICM's control over that injector.\n* The sound coming from the other side of the motor is unusual, but it's possible that it's related to the FICM's control over the injectors.\n* The black smoke and overfueling off idle suggest that the FICM is not properly controlling the fuel injectors.\n\nAs for the Bullydog tuner, it's possible that it's contributing to the problem. Try disconnecting the tuner and see if the symptoms persist. If they do, it's likely that the problem is with the FICM or another component.\n\nRegarding burned out FICMs, it's not uncommon for them to fail, especially on high-mileage vehicles.

The connectors for cylinders #2 and #7 are a known problem on the LLY Duramax. There's a revised connector and bracket kit (TSB 05-06-04-047c) that addresses this.\n\n2. For cylinder #5 causing black smoke: Check the injector seals and sleeve for leaks. The black smoke off idle suggests either combustion over-fueling due to a skewed sensor or lack of air from a clogged filter or turbo pressure issue.\n\n3. For the fuel knock in cylinder #1: Since replacing the injector didn't help and the sound comes from the opposite side, this could be related to the overall fuel system or tuning.\n\nAdditional checks:\n- Verify fuel quality (bio diesel or gas contamination can cause injector imbalances and knocking)\n- Clean the MAF sensor thoroughly\n- If you have a K&N type air filter, it might be throwing off MAF readings\n- Check for cracked injectors (a common Duramax issue)\n\nFor diagnosing injectors, search for \"white smoke diagnostics\" in the theory section of the forum for a good method to locate bad injectors.\n\nThe FICM will bump an injector up to positive seven at most, so cylinder #7 either isn't flowing properly or it's being used to balance out an adjacent cylinder.",

         "Based on the provided information, it seems like you've done a thorough job of diagnosing the issue with the 2008 Land Rover LR2 HSE's cooling fan. \n\nThe cooling fan on this model is controlled by the Engine Control Module (ECM) and is designed to turn on at a specific temperature. According to the factory specifications, the cooling fan should turn on at around 212°F (100°C) and turn off at around 203°F (95°C). However, these temperatures may vary slightly depending on the specific calibration of the ECM.\n\nThe fan control module is indeed connected to the ECM via a communication network, and it receives a ground signal from the ECM to activate the fan. The purple wire you mentioned is likely the signal wire that carries this ground signal from the ECM to the fan control module.\n\nRegarding the reliability of these modules, it's not uncommon for them to fail over time, especially if the vehicle has been exposed to extreme temperatures or has a history of overheating issues.\n\nAs for sourcing a replacement module, you're correct that the dealership may require you to purchase the entire fan assembly, which can be expensive. However, there are alternative sources for the fan control module. The part number for the module is likely to be specific to the vehicle's VIN, so it's essential to verify the correct part number before ordering.\n\nYou can try searching online for aftermarket suppliers or specialty Land Rover parts retailers that may carry the module. Some popular options include:\n\n* Atlantic British\n* Land Rover Parts\n* Rovers North\n* eBay (be cautious when purchasing from individual sellers)\n\nWhen searching for the module, make sure to provide the VIN and part number to ensure you receive the correct component.\n\nRegarding the Snap-on test results, it's not surprising that you didn't get any results when triggering the fan output circuit, as the module is likely faulty.\n\nBefore replacing the module, double-check the wiring and connections to ensure there are no other issues that could be causing the problem. If you're confident that the module is the culprit, replacing it should resolve the overheating issue.\n\nI hope this information helps you resolve the issue and get the vehicle back on the road.",

The module is controlled digitally by the PCM, and typically you need to purchase the complete fan assembly. Check alternative sources like atlanticbritish.com or roversnorth.com instead of the dealer for potentially better pricing.\n\n2. Temperature Control: The fan should be running at 100% by 221°F, with the PCM controlling fan speed via PWM. If it's reaching 228°F without fan activation, the module is likely bad as you suspect.\n\n3. Deeper Issues: The bubbling from the reservoir at 228°F suggests additional problems:\n   - Check the radiator cap pressure (often overlooked)\n   - Verify the water pump is functioning correctly\n   - Test for head gasket failure or engine damage (the quick overheating is concerning)\n   - Look for coolant in cylinders or air bubbles in coolant\n\n4. Diagnostic Approach:\n   - Use a capable scan tool to check coolant temp sensors\n   - Check the 5V NTC coolant sensor on the end of the block\n   - Perform a leak down test\n   - Pressurize the cooling system overnight to check for leaks\n\nThe purple wire likely carries the control signal from the PCM to the fan module.

Consider checking the converter's specifications and ensuring it meets the OEM requirements. You may also want to try a different brand or OEM converter to rule out any issues.\n\n2. **Oxygen Sensor**: You've already replaced the rear O2 sensor, but it's essential to verify that the new sensor is functioning correctly. Check the sensor's voltage and ensure it's within the specified range (usually between 0.1V and 1.0V). Also, inspect the sensor's wiring and connections for any signs of damage or corrosion.\n\n3. **Exhaust System Leaks**: A leak in the exhaust system can cause the P0420 code to reappear. Inspect the exhaust system, including the exhaust manifold, downpipe, and catalytic converter, for any signs of leaks or damage. Use a smoke machine or a leak-down test to help identify any potential leaks.\n\n4. **Fuel System**: Although the fuel trims are within a reasonable range, it's essential to check the fuel system for any issues. Verify that the fuel pressure is within the specified range (usually between 30-40 psi) and that the fuel filter is clean and not clogged.\n\n5. **Engine Mechanical**: Given the mileage and age of the vehicle, it's possible that there's an underlying engine mechanical issue contributing to the P0420 code. Check the engine for any signs of mechanical problems, such as low compression, excessive oil consumption, or coolant leaks.\n\n6. **Scan Tool Data**: Review the scan tool data, particularly the freeze frame data, to see if there are any other trouble codes or symptoms that might be related to the P0420 code. Also, check the engine's operating conditions, such as engine load, RPM, and temperature, to see if there are any patterns or correlations.\n\n7. **Wiring and Connections**: Inspect the wiring and connections related to the oxygen sensor, catalytic converter, and engine control module (ECM) for any signs of damage, corrosion, or wear.\n\nBy methodically checking these potential causes and performing the necessary tests, you should be able to identify and resolve the underlying issue causing the P0420 code to reappear.",

Replace the aftermarket Bosal converter with an OEM Subaru catalytic converter. This is the most consistent solution mentioned by multiple technicians who've faced this exact issue.\n\n2. When installing the OEM converter, make sure to:\n   - Install all heat shields properly\n   - Check the head pipe for internal leaks (especially if it's a double-wall design)\n   - Verify there are no exhaust leaks before the first O2 sensor\n\n3. If you're hesitant about the cost of an OEM converter, some techs have had better luck with DEC brand aftermarket converters than Bosal or Walker, but OEM is still the most reliable solution.\n\nYour fuel trims look good, and since there's no oil or antifreeze consumption, this really points to the aftermarket converter being the culprit.

A faulty CKP sensor can cause the engine to stall, and the symptoms you've described are consistent with this type of failure. Try swapping the CKP sensor with a known good unit to see if the problem persists.\n\n2. **Ignition Switch or Wiring:** Although you've inspected the wiring, it's possible that there's a intermittent fault in the ignition switch or wiring that's causing the loss of electrical signal. Try wiggling the ignition switch and wiring harness while the car is running to see if you can duplicate the problem.\n\n3. **ECU or Wiring Harness:** It's possible that there's a fault in the Engine Control Unit (ECU) or the wiring harness that's causing the problem. Given that the car starts right up after stalling, it's possible that the ECU is resetting itself after a brief loss of power. Try using a scan tool to monitor the ECU's live data while the car is running to see if you can spot any anomalies.\n\n4. **Battery or Charging System:** Although the car starts right up after stalling, it's possible that there's a problem with the battery or charging system that's causing a brief loss of power. Try checking the battery's state of charge and the charging system's output to ensure that everything is functioning properly.\n\n5. **CAN Bus System:** The 1999 Volkswagen Beetle uses a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus system to communicate between the various control modules. It's possible that there's a fault in the CAN bus system that's causing the problem. Try using a scan tool to monitor the CAN bus traffic while the car is running to see if you can spot any anomalies.\n\nIn terms of the tachometer and gauges going to zero when the car dies, it's likely that this is related to the loss of electrical signal.

Check the regulator and consider replacing it if necessary.\n\n2. **Clogged Fuel Injectors**: Even if you've replaced the fuel filter, clogged fuel injectors could still be causing the issue. Consider using a fuel injector cleaning kit to clear any blockages.\n\n3. **Vacuum Leaks**: A vacuum leak could be causing the hesitation, especially if it's intermittent. Inspect the intake manifold and hoses for any signs of leaks.\n\n4. **Ignition Issues**: Faulty spark plugs or ignition coils could also cause hesitation. Check the spark plugs and ignition coils for any signs of wear or damage.\n\n5. **Mass Airflow Sensor**: A faulty mass airflow sensor could be causing the engine to run rich, leading to hesitation. Consider replacing the sensor if necessary.\n\n6. **Clogged Catalytic Converter**: A clogged catalytic converter could be causing backpressure, leading to hesitation. Consider replacing the converter if necessary.\n\nBy addressing these potential causes, you should be able to resolve the hesitation issue and get your car running smoothly again.",
         "Based on the symptoms you've described, it's clear that the issue is related to the fuel system, but replacing the fuel pump and filter hasn't resolved the problem. Given that the car was running fine before the steering shaft knuckle installation and subframe lowering, it's possible that the issue is related to a vacuum leak or a faulty sensor.\n\nHere are a few potential causes to consider:\n\n1. **Vacuum Leak**: When you lowered the subframe, it's possible that you may have disturbed or damaged a vacuum hose or connection. Inspect the vacuum hoses and connections for any signs of damage, cracks, or loose connections. Make sure to check the hoses and connections related to the intake manifold, throttle body, and mass airflow sensor.\n2. **Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF)**: The MAF sensor measures the airflow entering the engine and sends a signal to the engine control module (ECM). If the MAF sensor is faulty or dirty, it can cause hesitation and stumbling. Try cleaning the MAF sensor with a soft brush and a mild detergent. If that doesn't work, consider replacing it.\n3. **Throttle Position Sensor (TPS)**: The TPS sensor measures the throttle valve opening and sends a signal to the ECM. If the TPS sensor is faulty, it can cause hesitation and stumbling. Check the TPS sensor for any signs of damage or wear. Try cleaning the sensor and its connections. If that doesn't work, consider replacing it.\n4. **Fuel Pressure Regulator (FPR)**: The FPR regulates the fuel pressure in the fuel system. If the FPR is faulty, it can cause hesitation and stumbling. Check the fuel pressure regulator for any signs of damage or wear. Try replacing it if necessary.\n5. **Wiring and Connections**: Inspect the wiring and connections related to the fuel system, MAF sensor, TPS sensor, and FPR for any signs of damage, corrosion, or wear.\n\nTo help you further diagnose the issue, I recommend using a scan tool to monitor the engine's parameters, such as fuel pressure, fuel flow, and engine speed, while the problem is occurring. This can help you identify any patterns or anomalies that may indicate the root cause of the problem.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to try a few tests to help isolate the issue:\n\n* Try disconnecting the MAF sensor and see if the problem persists. If it does, it may indicate a problem with the MAF sensor or its connections.\n* Try disconnecting the TPS sensor and see if the problem persists. If it does, it may indicate a problem with the TPS sensor or its connections.\n* Try using a fuel pressure gauge to monitor the fuel pressure while the problem is occurring. If the pressure drops or fluctuates, it may indicate a problem with the fuel pump, FPR, or fuel filter.\n\nI hope this helps you get closer to resolving the issue. Keep us updated on your progress!",

Check your turbo intake hoses and connections - the most likely culprit is a cracked or disconnected turbo hose that's leaking under boost. The subframe work could have disturbed these connections.\n\n2. Verify the Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor is functioning properly:\n   - Try unplugging it to see if running behavior changes\n   - Use an OBD scanner to monitor MAF readings (should be 12-14 gps at idle, increasing with RPM)\n   - Check fuel trim numbers for indications of a lean condition\n\n3. Your fuel pressure (60 psi) is close to spec (58 psi/4 bar), so that's likely not the issue, but check fuel pump volume at the rail under load - should be about 1/2 liter in 30 seconds.\n\n4. Inspect the catalytic converter for blockage - remove O2 sensor and test back pressure.\n\n5. Check anything else that might have been disturbed during the subframe work, particularly the mass air tube.\n\nThis is likely not directly caused by your repair work - something was probably ready to fail and the timing coincided with your maintenance.",

It's possible that the new ECM is not configured correctly, which could be preventing the monitors from setting.\n3. **Wiring and Connections**: Inspect the wiring and connections between the ECM, sensors, and other components. Corrosion, damage, or poor connections could be preventing the system from functioning correctly. Pay particular attention to the wiring harness and connectors.\n4. **Sensor Issues**: Although you've performed drive cycles, it's possible that one or more sensors are not functioning correctly, preventing the monitors from setting. Check the oxygen sensor, coolant temperature sensor, and other sensors to ensure they're working properly.\n5. **CAN Bus Communication**: The 1996 Saab 900 S uses a CAN (Controller Area Network) bus system. It's possible that there's a communication issue between the ECM and other modules, preventing the monitors from setting. Use a scan tool to monitor the CAN bus traffic and look for any errors or anomalies.\n6. **Battery and Charging System**: A weak or faulty battery or charging system can cause issues with the OBD-II system.

Check that the engine is reaching full operating temperature - this is critical for monitors to run. A faulty thermostat is very likely the culprit here, as several experienced techs have identified this as a common cause for this exact problem.\n\n2. Inspect the oxygen sensor functionality. Many monitors require proper O2 sensor input to verify their function (like air injection, EVAP, etc.). A failing O2 sensor could prevent multiple monitors from setting.\n\n3. Consider replacing:\n   - Thermostat (highest priority recommendation)\n   - Temperature sensor (if you want to be thorough)\n\n4. Verify the vehicle information is being entered correctly in the emissions testing equipment. Sometimes exemptions exist for certain vehicles/model years regarding monitor readiness, and incorrect data entry could cause unnecessary failures.\n\nThis appears to be a common issue with 1996-1997 Saab 900s with the 2.3L engine, but typically they eventually set monitors even if slowly.

         "It sounds like you're dealing with a tricky issue on your 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Here's a step-by-step approach to help you diagnose and potentially fix the problem:\n\n1. **Check the Timing Marks Again**: Ensure the timing marks are properly aligned. The marks should indeed be \"dot to dot\" when the crankshaft is at TDC (Top Dead Center). If they're 180 degrees out, it could indicate a timing issue.\n\n2. **Inspect the Timing Chain**: Look for any signs of wear or damage on the timing chain. If it's stretched or broken, it could cause the timing to be off.\n\n3. **Check the Crankshaft Position Sensor**: This sensor tells the ECM when the crankshaft is at TDC. If it's faulty, it could prevent the engine from running.\n\n4. **Test the Fuel Injectors**: Use a noid light to check if the injectors are pulsing. If not, it could indicate an issue with the ECM or wiring.\n\n5. **Check for Codes**: Use a scanner to see if there are any trouble codes stored in the ECM. This can give you a clue about what's going on.\n\n6. **Consider a Professional Inspection**: If you're still stumped, it might be worth having a professional mechanic take a look. They can perform more advanced diagnostics and repairs.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and fix the issue. Good luck!",
         "It sounds like you've done some great troubleshooting so far, but I think I can help clarify a few things.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the timing marks. On a 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4.0L engine, the timing marks are indeed supposed to be dot-to-dot when the crankshaft is at TDC (Top Dead Center). However, it's possible that the marks you're seeing are correct, but the timing chain has jumped a tooth or two.\n\nWhen you say the camshaft mark is on the opposite side, approximately 180 degrees out, that's a pretty big discrepancy. If the timing chain has jumped, it could be causing the engine to not run properly.\n\nHere's what I would suggest:\n\n1. Double-check the timing marks again, and make sure you're looking at the correct marks. There should be a mark on the crankshaft sprocket and a corresponding mark on the camshaft sprocket. Make sure they're aligned properly.\n2. If the marks are correct, but the engine still won't run, try rotating the crankshaft a few degrees and see if the engine will fire. If it does, it could indicate that the timing chain has jumped.\n3. If the engine still won't run, I would recommend checking the timing chain tensioner and the timing chain itself for any signs of wear or damage. If the chain is worn or damaged, it could be causing the timing to be off.\n4. Since you've already dropped the exhaust to rule out a plugged exhaust, that's a good step. However, I would also recommend checking the fuel pressure to make sure it's within spec. Low fuel pressure could be causing the engine to not run properly.\n\nAs for the ECM, if you've already replaced it and the problem persists, it's unlikely that the ECM is the culprit.\n\nLastly, take a deep breath and don't lose your cool. Troubleshooting can be frustrating, but it's a process of elimination. You're getting closer to finding the problem, and with a little more patience and persistence, you'll get your Jeep running again.\n\nKeep us posted on your progress, and if you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask!",
         "Based on your description, it sounds like you're concerned about the timing marks being 180 degrees out when the crank is at TDC. This is actually normal for a 4-stroke engine - the cam turns at half the speed of the crankshaft, so every other revolution will show the cam mark 180 degrees out.\n\nSince you've verified:\n- Good compression (150 psi across all cylinders)\n- Spark is present\n- Fuel is within specs (32-39 psi)\n- Timing appears correct\n\nHere are some things to check:\n\n1. Verify you're on the compression stroke for cylinder #1 when checking timing. You can put a paper towel in the #1 plug hole and bump the starter - when it blows out, you're approaching compression TDC.\n\n2. Check that the distributor is properly indexed. The rotor should be pointing to #1 when the engine is at TDC compression stroke. Some Jeep models had timing changes between years, so the distributor timing might need adjustment.\n\n3. Verify you have adequate injector pulse - you have fuel pressure, but are the injectors actually firing?\n\n4. Check fuel quality and look for contamination.\n\n5. Test the spark strength - you have spark, but is it strong enough?\n\nThe fact that your compression is good (150 psi) indicates the mechanical timing is likely correct.

Here are some steps and considerations to help resolve the problem:\n\n1. **Check the Brake Drums**: Ensure the drums are properly seated and not warped. If they are warped, consider resurfacing or replacing them. Even if they look good, a slight warp can cause uneven contact with the brake shoes, leading to dragging.\n\n2. **Inspect the Brake Shoes**: Verify that the shoes are installed correctly, with the shorter shoe in the front as you've done. Also, check if the shoes are properly seated in their clips and that the clips are not bent, which could cause the shoes to drag.\n\n3. **Adjust the Brake Shoes**: Make sure the shoes are adjusted so they are just barely touching the drums when the brakes are applied. If they're too loose, they might drag.\n\n4. **Check the Parking Brake**: Even though you've mentioned the parking brake cables are fine and loose, double-check that they're not sticking or binding, which could cause the rear brakes to drag.\n\n5. **Inspect the Brake Hardware**: Look for any bent or damaged parts that could be causing the shoes to drag.

         "It sounds like you've done a thorough job of troubleshooting the issue with your 1996 Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon's rear brakes. Given the symptoms you've described, I'd like to offer a few potential causes and suggestions for further diagnosis.\n\nFirstly, the fact that the problem goes away when you remove the torque from the wheel nuts suggests that there might be an issue with the brake drum or the wheel bearing. However, since you've already cut the drums and they're in excellent shape, it's unlikely to be a drum-related problem.\n\nThe fact that the drum was loose on the brake shoes when you removed the wheel is interesting. This could indicate that the brake shoes are not being held in place properly, or that there's excessive clearance between the shoes and the drum. Since you've already checked the adjustment and it's not the issue, it's possible that the problem lies with the brake shoe retaining hardware or the brake shoe pivot pins.\n\nRegarding the proportional valve, it's unlikely to be the cause of the problem. The proportional valve is typically used to regulate the pressure to the front and rear brakes, but it's not directly related to the brake shoe adjustment or the drum-to-shoe clearance.\n\nI'd like to suggest a few things to try:\n\n1. Check the brake shoe retaining hardware (springs, clips, etc.) to ensure they're in good condition and properly seated.\n2. Inspect the brake shoe pivot pins for any signs of wear or corrosion. Make sure they're properly lubricated and seated.\n3. Verify that the brake shoes are properly aligned and seated in the brake shoe holders.\n4. Check the wheel bearing for any signs of wear or play. It's possible that the bearing is loose, causing the drum to move slightly and create the dragging sensation.\n5. Try bleeding the brake system to ensure there's no air in the lines. This might help to resolve the issue.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the WBR brake shoes you installed have a metallic compound, which can be more aggressive than standard brake shoes. This might be contributing to the dragging sensation, especially if the brake shoes are not properly seated or aligned.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you to further diagnose and resolve the issue with your Roadmaster's rear brakes.",
         "Based on your description, it sounds like your new brake shoes are too wide and are causing drag when the wheel is torqued down. This is a common issue with aftermarket brake shoes, especially \"grabby\" ones like the WBR World Pack shoes you installed.\n\nHere's what you should do:\n\n1. Compare the width of your new shoes to the original ones - they're likely wider, which causes them to contact the drum when tightened.\n\n2. Look for witness marks by applying some paint to the inside of the drum, installing it with lug nuts, rotating it several times, then removing to see where contact is occurring.\n\n3. Consider replacing the shoes with standard OEM-equivalent shoes rather than the \"grabby\" metallic compound ones.

         "Based on your description, it sounds like you're dealing with a common issue on these 3.4L V6 engines. The noise you're hearing is likely coming from the intake manifold, specifically the expansion chambers or baffles that are attached to the air intake hose. These components are known to crack and cause a hissing or whooshing sound, especially when accelerating.\n\nHere's what you can try:\n\n1. **Inspect the intake manifold**: Look for any cracks or damage in the intake manifold, especially around the expansion chambers. You can use a flashlight and a mirror to get a better view.\n2. **Check the EGR system**: Make sure the EGR valve is functioning properly and not stuck open. A faulty EGR valve can cause a hissing sound.\n3. **Test the MAF sensor**: Try cleaning the MAF sensor with a MAF cleaner or replacing it if necessary. A dirty or faulty MAF sensor can cause issues with airflow and engine performance.\n4. **Check for vacuum leaks**: Inspect the intake manifold and hoses for any signs of vacuum leaks. Use a smoke test or a vacuum gauge to help identify any leaks.\n\nBy addressing these potential issues, you should be able to resolve the noise and improve engine performance.",
         "It sounds like you've already done some good troubleshooting on this 1997 Toyota 4Runner SR5. Given the symptoms you've described, I'd like to offer a few potential causes and suggestions for further diagnosis.\n\nFirst, the fact that the engine runs well in open loop and doesn't make the noise in the air intake expansion chambers or baffles suggests that the issue might be related to the Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF) or the air intake system. Since unplugging the MAF didn't make a difference, it's possible that the issue is downstream of the MAF.\n\nThe noise in the air intake expansion chambers or baffles could be related to a vacuum leak or a restriction in the air intake system. Have you checked the air intake hose and the connections to the throttle body for any signs of leaks or restrictions? It's possible that there's a crack or a hole in the hose or a loose connection that's causing the noise.\n\nAnother possibility is that the issue is related to the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system. The EGR system is designed to reduce emissions by recirculating some of the exhaust gases back into the engine. However, if the EGR system is not functioning properly, it can cause hesitation and noise in the air intake system. You might want to check the EGR valve and the EGR vacuum hose for any signs of leaks or blockages.\n\nFinally, it's also possible that the issue is related to the ignition system. A faulty ignition coil or spark plug could be causing the hesitation and noise. You might want to check the spark plugs and ignition coil for any signs of wear or damage.\n\nIn terms of the noise sounding like an exhaust leak on the right bank, it's possible that the noise is being transmitted through the air intake system. However, if you've already checked the exhaust system and didn't find any leaks, it's likely that the noise is coming from somewhere else.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you further diagnose the issue. If you have any more questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask.\n\nAlso, just to clarify, when you say \"expansion chambers or baffles that are attached to air intake hose\", are you referring to the resonator or the air intake duct?",

Diagnostic data would be helpful:\n   - Fuel trim readings (at idle, 2500 RPM cruise, and WOT)\n   - Fuel pressure at WOT\n   - O2 sensor behavior at WOT\n   - Any stored codes\n\n3. Since you mentioned it runs better in open loop, focus on sensors that affect closed loop operation:\n   - TPS (Throttle Position Sensor)\n   - MAF (Mass Air Flow) sensor - you mentioned unplugging it didn't help, but it could still be faulty\n   - O2 sensors - inspect and test these\n   - Cam and crank position sensors\n\n4. The noise in the air intake during closed loop operation is interesting. Check for:\n   - Vacuum leaks\n   - Damaged baffles in the intake\n   - Possible exhaust leak affecting intake operation\n\nSince you've already ruled out restricted exhaust and verified fuel pressure, these would be my next diagnostic steps.

However, the fact that the relay is not engaging consistently until the voltage reaches a certain threshold (over 6 volts) suggests that there may be an issue with the relay itself or the wiring/circuitry leading to it.\n\nThe fact that someone had previously soldered a wire to the relay pole (terminal 85) and installed a start button on the dash, which allowed the car to crank when the button was pushed, suggests that there may be an issue with the wiring or circuitry leading to the relay. It's possible that the wiring or circuitry is not providing a consistent or strong enough signal to the relay to engage it properly.\n\nThe fact that the exhaust cam position sensor is not counting up with the key on is a good clue.

The ABS module is the primary source of vehicle speed data, which is then sent to the instrument cluster and the transmission control module (TCM) via the CAN bus. So, if the ABS module is not functioning correctly, it's likely to cause issues with the speedometer and transmission control.\n\nRegarding the wheel speed sensors, I feel your pain - they can be pricey. However, I've found that the LJA2226AA sensor is actually a pretty common part, and you might be able to find a cheaper alternative. After some digging, I found that the LJA2226AA sensor is similar to the one used on some Ford and Land Rover models. You might want to try searching for the following part numbers:\n\n* Ford: 6L2Z-2C204-A (this one is a direct replacement, but it's still a bit pricey)\n* Land Rover: LR007414 (this one is a bit cheaper, but it might require some minor modifications to work on your XJR)\n\nKeep in mind that these sensors might not be exact replacements, so you'll need to double-check the wiring and connector compatibility before installing them.\n\nAs for the ABS module, I'd recommend checking the wiring and connections first. Make sure there are no signs of damage or corrosion. If the wiring looks good, you might want to try resetting the ABS module or replacing the ABS module relay. If none of these steps work, you might need to replace the ABS module itself.\n\nLastly, I'd recommend checking the CAN bus wiring and connections as well.

Yes, the speedometer on your Jag does take speed information from the ABS module via the CAN network. When this data is missing, the car will try to calculate from other sources, which explains your intermittent speedometer and transmission failure messages.\n\n2. For the wheel speed sensors (part #LJA2226AA), before replacing the expensive sensors themselves, check the harnesses first. Multiple techs confirm that it's usually the harnesses that fail, not the sensors themselves. Jaguar designed these with replaceable harnesses, which is much more cost-effective.\n\n3. Diagnostic approach:\n   - Use a proper scan tool that can interface with Jaguar systems to pull ABS/TCS codes\n   - Check the fly leads going to the sensors by disconnecting at both the sensor and engine compartment ends, then ohm out the wires\n   - Inspect the torque of rear axle nuts (loose nuts can cause the ABS ring to spin freely)\n   - Look for dry soldered joints at the pump wiring on the circuit board in the ABS module\n\n4. If the ABS module itself is bad, consider using BBA Reman who can fix them for less than $200, which is much cheaper than a new unit. Using your original repaired unit avoids programming issues that might occur with a replacement unit.\n\nThis appears to be a common issue with these vehicles, and checking the harnesses should be your first step before investing in expensive sensors.",

Given that you've already checked the basics such as fuel pressure, ignition timing, and valve timing, here are a few potential areas to investigate further:\n\n1. **Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF)**: Although you mentioned the MAP voltage seems off, it's possible that the MAF sensor is not providing the correct airflow reading to the ECU. Try cleaning or replacing the MAF sensor to see if it makes a difference.\n\n2. **Intake Manifold Vacuum Leaks**: Since you've ruled out a plugged exhaust, it's possible that there's a vacuum leak in the intake manifold. Use a smoke machine or a propane test to identify any potential leaks.\n\n3. **Throttle Position Sensor (TPS)**: The TPS could be providing incorrect readings to the ECU, leading to a lean condition. Check the TPS voltage and adjust or replace it if necessary.\n\n4. **Idle Air Control (IAC) Valve**: The IAC valve could be stuck or faulty, causing the engine to run lean under load. Try cleaning or replacing the IAC valve to see if it resolves the issue.\n\n5. **Torque Converter**: You mentioned the stall speed seems low, which could be contributing to the lack of power under load.

Your timing belt may have jumped a tooth or more. This would explain both the performance issues and lean condition. Double-check all timing marks carefully.\n\n2. **Important note**: Your 2.2L Camry uses a MAP sensor system, not a MAF sensor (several responses incorrectly suggested MAF issues).\n\n3. **Vacuum leaks** - Check for any vacuum leaks, especially from the brake booster or intake manifold. These can cause lean conditions.\n\n4. **Air/Fuel Ratio Sensor** - The A/F sensor could be lazy or out of calibration. This would directly affect your P0171 code and performance.\n\n5. **Fuel delivery** - While your pressure tests good at 51 psi, check the fuel filter as it could be restricting flow under load.\n\n6. **Compression test** - Run a compression test to verify engine mechanical condition. Should be around 175-180 psi.\n\nI'd start with verifying the timing belt position as this is the most likely culprit given your symptoms and is relatively easy to check.

         "Based on the provided information, it seems like you're dealing with a complex issue on this 2008 Volvo S80 T6. Given the codes P1170-68, P061A62, and P061B64, it's clear that the car's computer is detecting some inconsistencies in the engine's performance.\n\nFirstly, the P1170-68 code is more of an informational code, as Volvo's description suggests, and it doesn't necessarily point to a specific fault. However, the other two codes (P061A62 and P061B64) are more concerning, as they indicate a potential issue with the engine's torque performance algorithm.\n\nConsidering the list of possible causes provided by Volvo, it's indeed a broad range of potential issues. However, since the car is running fine at the moment, it's essential to focus on the most likely causes.\n\nGiven the symptoms of hesitation and the fact that the codes didn't return after clearing, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Inspect the air intake system**: Check for any signs of air leaks, damaged or loose connections, and ensure that the air filter is clean. A vacuum leak or a faulty Mass Airflow Sensor (MAF) could be causing the hesitation.\n2. **Check the throttle unit**: Verify that the throttle unit is functioning correctly and that there are no issues with the throttle position sensor.\n3. **Monitor the turbocharger**: Although the turbocharger is listed as a possible cause, it's essential to monitor its performance. Check the turbocharger's boost pressure and ensure it's within the specified range.\n4. **Verify the Crankshaft Position Sensor (CKP) and Camshaft Position Sensor (CMP)**: These sensors play a crucial role in engine performance.

Since you haven't experienced the hesitation issue yourself, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.\n\nSeveral things to check:\n\n1. ECM/TCM Software - Make sure the vehicle has the latest software updates\n\n2. Boost Pressure Sensor - This is a common culprit with these symptoms\n\n3. Throttle Body - Some Volvos from this era had known throttle body issues that Volvo sometimes covered for free. Worth checking with the dealer.\n\n4. Check Fuel Trims - These would be very helpful diagnostic data. Look for mismatches between fuel trims and O2 sensor readings which could indicate a dirty/faulty MAF sensor.\n\n5. Intake Leaks - Could be an intake manifold gasket that only leaks under specific temperature/pressure conditions. Try spraying some carb cleaner where the intake meets the head and watch for changes in Short Term Fuel Trim.\n\n6. Spark Plugs - At 106k miles, they're likely due for replacement and worn plugs can cause these compensation-related codes.\n\n7. Fuel Pressure/Temperature Sensor - These have been known to cause similar issues in this model.\n\nSince the car isn't currently exhibiting the problem, try to get freeze frame data when it does act up - sometimes this is available in generic OBD2 mode even if not shown in Volvo-specific diagnostics.\n\nUse only OE brand sensors if you need to replace any - these engines don't respond well to aftermarket parts.",

These systems often rely on both the controller ground and ECM ground as backup.\n\n3. Check the 4 ABS controller fuses - a visual inspection is quick and might save you time.\n\n4. Inspect the wheel speed sensors for broken wires - this is a common failure point.\n\n5. Try to communicate with the ABS controller to pull diagnostic trouble codes if possible.\n\n6. Test each speed sensor by measuring resistance (ohm reading).\n\n7. Check all power and ground connections at the controller (a halogen bulb test can be helpful).\n\n8. As a diagnostic step, you could run a jumper wire bypassing the suspect wire to see if that resolves the issue - this would confirm if you have a voltage drop on that specific line due to a partially damaged wire.\n\nThis methodical approach should help you isolate the problem before disassembling the dash unnecessarily.",

Try using a scan tool or a separate temperature gauge to verify the engine temperature.\n\n3. **Low coolant flow rate**: The 2.3L engine in your Buick Skylark has a relatively low coolant flow rate compared to other engines. This can cause issues with cooling, especially at low speeds. You might want to consider installing a high-flow water pump or a coolant flow enhancer to see if that improves the situation.\n\n4. **Air in the cooling system**: Air pockets in the cooling system can cause poor circulation and overheating. Try bleeding the cooling system to remove any air pockets.\n\n5. **Radiator fan switch or wiring issue**: Although you mentioned the cooling fans are operating properly, it's possible that the fan switch or wiring is faulty, causing the fans to not operate correctly at low speeds.

Consider having the radiator removed and flow tested - it may have internal restrictions that aren't obvious.\n\n2. **Head Gasket Issue**: This is a known problem on these engines. Test for combustion gases in the cooling system using a CO2 tester. Even a small head gasket leak can cause these symptoms.\n\n3. **Coolant Mixture**: Check if your antifreeze is mixed too strong. Nearly pure antifreeze doesn't flow well at low speeds and transfers heat poorly.\n\n4. **Heater Core Restriction**: Try bypassing the heater core with clear hose to observe flow.\n\n5. **Radiator Obstruction**: Check between the radiator and condenser for debris blocking airflow.\n\n6. **Pump/Thermostat Installation**: Ensure proper clearance between pump impeller and block. Try removing the thermostat temporarily to check flow.\n\n7. **Temperature Sensor**: Verify the temp sensor is functioning correctly.\n\nSince you've already replaced the water pump and thermostat, I'd recommend:\n1. Test for combustion gases in coolant\n2. Have the radiator flow tested\n3.

         "Based on your description, this is a common issue with Subarus in very cold weather. Here are the most likely causes and solutions:\n\n1. Fuel line clamps - The most common culprit. In cold weather, different expansion rates between metals and rubber can cause slight seepage. Check and tighten all fuel line clamps, especially:\n   - Near the fuel rail connections (particularly by #1 and #3 injectors)\n   - Under the hood where hoses connect to the rail\n   - At the fuel filter\n\n2. Plastic quick-connects - Examine the fuel line connections at the left forward area of the fuel tank near the left rear suspension. These plastic connectors often become problematic in cold weather.\n\n3. Short fuel lines - Look at the two short fuel lines on both sides of the engine in front of the injector rails. These can harden and crack in cold weather. Try wiggling or applying pressure to these lines after a cold start to see if they leak.\n\n4. Fuel tank vent system - At temperatures around 18°F or colder, moisture can freeze in the fuel tank's vent system.

These are all common culprits when it comes to overheating issues. However, since the problem persists, let's dive deeper.\n\nConsidering the symptoms you've described, I'd like to focus on a few potential causes:\n\n1. **Air in the cooling system**: Although you've tried bleeding the system using the Subaru procedure and an air-lift vacuum, I'd recommend trying a more aggressive approach. You can try using a cooling system vacuum pump to remove any air pockets that might be trapped in the system. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions and take necessary precautions.\n2. **Cylinder head or engine block issue**: The raised spot on the ring around cylinder #4 could be a sign of a more significant problem. I'd recommend performing a leak-down test or a compression test to identify any potential issues with the cylinder head or engine block. This might help you pinpoint the source of the problem.\n3. **Cooling fan operation**: You mentioned that the cooling fans come on at around 214-215°F and go off at 208°F. This seems like a normal operating range. However, I'd like to suggest checking the fan wiring and relay to ensure they're functioning correctly. You can also try swapping the fan relay with a known good one to rule out any electrical issues.\n4. **Radiator hoses and connections**: Double-check the radiator hoses and connections for any signs of leakage or blockage. Make sure they're securely connected and not restricting coolant flow.\n5. **Engine management system**: Although you've mentioned that the vehicle runs fine on the highway, I'd like to suggest checking the engine management system for any trouble codes or issues. A faulty engine management system can cause the engine to run rich, leading to increased coolant temperatures.\n\nTo further assist you, I have a few questions:\n\n* Have you checked the coolant level and condition? Is it at the recommended level, and is it a 50/50 mix of coolant and water?\n* Have you inspected the engine block and cylinder head for any signs of damage or excessive wear?\n* Are there any other symptoms or issues present, such as oil leaks or unusual noises?\n\nBy exploring these potential causes and addressing any underlying issues, you should be able to resolve the overheating problem on this 2009 Subaru Outback 2.5i.",
         "Based on your description, it sounds like you're dealing with a heater core issue in your 2009 Subaru Outback. Several key points to consider:\n\n1. The symptom of overheating at slow speeds but running fine at highway speeds suggests an airflow or circulation problem rather than a head gasket issue.\n\n2. Since you've already replaced the head gaskets (twice), thermostat, radiator, and water pump with no improvement, the heater core is the most likely culprit.\n\n3. The heater core is a critical part of the Subaru cooling circuit - it's not just an \"add-on\" but an essential path for proper coolant circulation.\n\nTo diagnose and fix:\n\n1. Check the temperature difference between the two heater hoses - a significant difference indicates restriction.\n\n2. Try bypassing the heater core as a test - connect the hoses together and see if the overheating resolves.\n\n3. Look for signs of a leaking heater core: wet carpets, coolant film on windshield, or sweet smell from vents.\n\n4. The original overheating episode may have caused silicate from the coolant to drop out and create blockages in the heater core.\n\n5. Air pockets in the heater core are common in Subarus - try bleeding the system with the front end raised and one heater hose disconnected to release trapped air.\n\nMost likely you'll need to replace the heater core to fully resolve this issue. The restriction is probably allowing enough flow at highway speeds (higher pump pressure) but not at lower speeds.",

Sometimes, a weak or dying 12V battery can cause the caution light to come on intermittently, especially if it's not holding a charge. Also, check the connections to the 12V battery and the hybrid battery pack for any signs of corrosion or loose connections. Additionally, try using a scan tool to monitor the hybrid system's voltage and current readings to see if there are any fluctuations when the caution light comes on.

Check the inverter and converter for any signs of overheating, corrosion, or physical damage.\n3. **Battery Pack or Module issue**: Although the main battery light comes on, it's possible that there's an issue with one of the battery modules or the battery pack as a whole. You may want to perform a battery test using a Toyota-approved battery tester to check the battery's state of charge, voltage, and internal resistance.\n4. **Communication issue between HCM and other modules**: The HCM communicates with other modules, such as the Engine Control Module (ECM) and the Battery Management Module (BMM). A communication issue between these modules could cause the symptoms you've described.

         "Based on your description, there are several potential issues to investigate with your 2002 Prius showing the caution light and power loss without setting codes:\n\n1. First, clarify which warning light you're seeing - the orange turtle light or red triangle? This distinction matters for diagnosis.\n\n2. Check the high voltage battery:\n   - Use your scan tool to check the \"delta SOC\" parameter - if it's greater than 20%, the HV battery is degraded and likely needs replacement\n   - Verify the HV battery cooling system is working properly - check the fan on the left side of the trunk area and ensure the inlet vent above the rear seat isn't blocked\n\n3. Check other modules for codes:\n   - The warning light will always be on in inspection mode\n   - Try scanning all modules (not just engine/hybrid) including ABS for HV-related codes\n   - If you can't communicate with certain modules, they may be offline which itself indicates a problem\n\n4. Additional checks:\n   - Verify engine oil level is correct (low oil can trigger warnings)\n   - Check the 12V battery condition\n   - Consider performing a Vehicle Steering Angle (VSA) reset\n   - Inspect the MAF sensor for debris if you've done throttle body work\n   - Check transaxle fluid for contamination\n\n5. Test under load conditions:\n   - Record data while driving uphill with heavy acceleration\n   - Watch for modules dropping offline during acceleration or spiking during braking\n\nIt's unusual to have no codes with these symptoms, so either there's a mechanical issue or you need to look in less obvious modules for the fault codes.",

The fact that the smoke only appears when the engine is warm and under load suggests that it's related to the engine's operating conditions.\n\nGiven that you've found oil in the intake manifold, particularly in the #3 runner, and the PCV system seems to be functioning correctly, I'd like to suggest a few possibilities:\n\n1. **Clogged or faulty PCV hose**: Although you've checked the PCV hose for leaks, it's possible that it's clogged or restricted, causing the engine to draw oil into the intake manifold. Try replacing the PCV hose or cleaning it thoroughly to ensure it's not the culprit.\n2. **Intake manifold gasket leak**: The oil in the intake manifold could be coming from a leaky intake manifold gasket. Inspect the gasket and replace it if necessary.\n3. **Piston ring or cylinder wall issue**: Although the pistons and cylinder walls looked clean with the bore scope, it's possible that there's a problem with the piston rings or cylinder walls that's causing oil to seep into the combustion chamber and then into the intake manifold. This could be due to wear or damage.\n4. **Valve guide seals**: Although you're replacing the valve stem seals, it's possible that the valve guide seals are also faulty. Inspect the valve guides and replace the seals if necessary.\n5. **Crankcase ventilation system issue**: The fact that the PCV system seems to be functioning correctly, but there's still oil in the intake manifold, suggests that there might be an issue with the crankcase ventilation system. Check the crankcase ventilation system, including the oil separator and the hoses, for any blockages or restrictions.\n\nTo further diagnose the issue, I'd recommend:\n\n* Running the engine with the PCV hose disconnected from the valve cover to see if the smoking decreases or stops.

Good luck!",
         "Based on the symptoms you're describing, this is almost certainly a failing turbo. Here's why:\n\n1. The sudden onset of heavy smoke is a classic turbo failure symptom\n2. The fact that it smokes worse when warm and when revved points to the turbo\n3. Clean spark plugs despite heavy smoking suggests the oil isn't entering through the combustion chamber\n4. The oil you found in the intake manifold is another strong indicator\n\nEven though you didn't see oil at the turbo exhaust connection, it doesn't mean the turbo isn't leaking. Oil can leak into the exhaust side and be completely burned off by the time it reaches where you checked. It only takes a small amount of oil past the turbine seals to create massive smoke.\n\nSeveral things to check:\n- Check for play in the turbo shaft/impeller\n- Inspect the intercooler for oil contamination\n- Look at the PCV system, particularly the check valve that prevents boost pressure from pushing oil into the intake\n- Verify the air filter housing isn't restricted (can create vacuum that pulls oil in)\n\nI'd recommend replacing the turbo before reassembling everything.

However, it's always a good idea to perform some additional tests to confirm the diagnosis before replacing the MDK.\n\nHere are a few tests you can perform to help verify the issue:\n\n1. **Throttle Position Sensor (TPS) Test**: Use a scan tool to monitor the TPS voltage while the engine is running. The voltage should be around 0.5V at idle and increase to around 4.5V at WOT (wide open throttle). If the voltage is erratic or doesn't follow the expected pattern, it could indicate a problem with the TPS or the MDK.\n2. **Throttle Actuator Test**: Use a scan tool to perform a throttle actuator test. This test will command the throttle to move to a specific position and then hold it there. If the throttle doesn't respond or doesn't hold the commanded position, it could indicate a problem with the MDK.\n3. **Wiring Harness Test**: As you mentioned, check the wiring harness for continuity between the MDK and the engine control module (ECM). Make sure to check for any signs of damage, corrosion, or wear on the wiring and connectors.\n4. **Scan Tool Monitoring**: Use a scan tool to monitor the engine's performance while driving. Pay attention to the throttle position, engine speed, and fuel trim values. If the throttle position is erratic or the engine speed is fluctuating, it could indicate a problem with the MDK.\n5. **Visual Inspection**: Perform a visual inspection of the MDK and its surroundings. Look for any signs of physical damage, corrosion, or wear on the MDK or its connectors.\n\nIf these tests confirm that the MDK is faulty, it's likely that replacing it will resolve the issue. However, if the tests don't confirm the MDK as the culprit, you may need to dig deeper to find the root cause of the problem.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the exhaust cam sensor code you mentioned earlier could be related to the current issue.

Some have had temporary success cleaning the potentiometer's sweeper arm, but replacement is the recommended permanent solution.\n\n2. Fuel System Issues - Check if there's any damage to the passenger side fuel tank, as this could affect the fuel pump module. A broken plastic component inside the tank could cause your symptoms.\n\n3. Additional checks to perform before replacing the throttle:\n   - Check the pedal travel sensor\n   - Measure fuel pressure during the cut-out episodes\n   - Use a DSO (Digital Storage Oscilloscope) to sweep the throttle position sensor\n   - Inspect oxygen sensors (should have been replaced at 100K miles)\n   - Check if the fuel filter is clogged\n\nI'd recommend scanning for fault codes again and performing these diagnostic steps to confirm the electronic throttle is indeed the problem before replacement.
