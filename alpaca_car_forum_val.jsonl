Does that open just the 2 front as well or all 4 doors? These units are common for failing. It could be a faulty switch there in the middle console, but unlikely if the 2 front are working. I would start by removing the central lock fuse and see what happens, everything should open manually. I would aslo remove the switch in the middle console, these are know for getting ruined from coke, water etc.\n\nThe lock signal out of the general module (body control unit) for the rear doors and gas door is pins number 13 (black roughly 12gage wire) and pin number 14 (blue,12gauge wire)Of the large connector on the general module. the signal toggles back and forth for lock and unlock. The general module is located behind the glove box. With all three not working. I would test this signal first. I hope that helps.\n\npeter, i agree with posts about gm and gas door actuator, but check fuses closesly..these blade type fuses with the open tops will sometimes crack not blow and when you test with your test light you actually wind up pushing the crack in fuse shut which completes the circuit.. i mentioned this because it happened that way to me on a same model year car with same symptom.. good luck"}

Just because the headgaskets where changed doesn't mean that there isn't a problem with either the cylinder head itself or the engine block. The machine shope that milled the deck should have partical inspected the heads for cracks. These cracks can be invisible to the naked eye, but will cause the same problem as a blown head gasket. The engine block could also have a crack in it, this would not show up under compression test or cylinger leakage. One other things that I would consider would be a bad intake mainfold gasket. I would find thid unlikely however because this would normally cause anti-freeze to leak into the crank case. Seth...fourtytozero@yahoo.comDo You Yahoo!?

You could run it with the rocker cover off and see for anything obvious. Could it be a vvti problem? If this has it? Did the motor come with an intake? Could something be dropped down the intake port?\n\nI would check the cam shaft scissor gear for alignment, you should use a bolt to hold the alignment.Good luck Shawn\n\nHad a tech let one of these engines eat something ( don't know what ) but what ever it was knocked 1 valve keeper out of 2 different valve. believe it or not it didn't drop a valve. It was on the right side also. Good luck. Mark\n\nYou have t check the valve clearance cold. And did your tech find any shims not to spec? These things do make noise when the gap is to large and a proper shim may be all you need.\n\nI agree with Wayne from Florida. These are typically good motors and not an issue with a used one. However, it is not impossible that someone had messed with the engine prior to you receiving it. A simple test you can do to check if it is in the valves is to temporarily change the viscosity of the oil. This may change the noise and may help you get closer to finding the cause.\n\nThose cam gears have to be preloaded and a bolt placed into the gear to lock in place before installed. Once installed you can remove the bolt and it will be ok otherwise you get a noise. It could be that. Might be time to pull the pan and check the inside for bearing material. I had a Tundra that made a noise that sounded upper end and it had bearing material in the bottom of the pan when I pulled it. Toyota told me it's not uncommon to think it's coming from the upper end when it's bottom end one an all aluminum Toyota engine as the sound resonates. Just thinking top of my head here former Toyota dealer tech.\n\nTry to pinpoint which bank is the noise source. If it sound like a metallic ticking noise with the rhythm of a valve opening than you have to pull the cylinder head and reseat ( lap) the valves. Remove the camshaft and lifters and open and close the valves. See if the noise of closing the valve manually is the same. Other option is to red line the engine few times for several seconds. If something was trapped into the piston head may need to be seated. It is an easy friendly engine to work on. Unfortunately seems like you not getting paid for this. Good luck!"}

I recommend you quit bankrupting yourself trying to be all things to all people.Many are learning a hard reality to only stick to one or maybe two brands these days, and even then limiting what models. We are in an age of specialization.Technology is moving so rapidly that even new models are having running production upgrades on a frequent basis.In 20 more years there will be practically nobody qualified to work on vehicles. Teams of engineers build these things but no one is educating the techs who are working on them. Many of the systems are not designed to be worked on. Vehicles are going just as any other electronics device, they are becoming an expendable commodity.Average laptop 3K... Average car 30K... life expectancy for each 3-5 years. Some, may be more, but many may be less.Sorry for the gray clouds, but quit beating your self up. I will not work on anything newer than a 2015. I for one cannot afford it.\n\nI think we have all been let down by an aftermarket scan tool at some point. It sucks to say the least. I did not reply to your post because I did not have SI active at that time but it would not have mattered in this case. At least you figured it out. That is saying something for you.\n\nThe step after replacement of pads on mitchell is to go straight to parking brake calibration, not parking brake extend. This issue happened to two seperate 2019 equinoxs'. I tried reprogramming this last one, but it seems once you get to the point you are at, the only option to fix it is an EBCM and reprogram. I seperated the hydraulic unit and replaced the EBCM with a used unit and reprogrammed.

I found my draw would go away if I removed power to the main cable from the under hood junction box to the under dash junction box. I removed all the fuses and relays in the junction box under the dash and still had a draw. I removed all the main power cables to the junction box and still had a draw. I traced the cable back and found the command start was tied into that wire. I found two relays that were part of the starter and one was powered up and engaged at all times. I unhooked power to the relay and the draw went away. It was 19mA. I reassembled all components and retested for a draw. It was back, 230mA. I removed the command start completely and all the related wiring harnesses. I returned it to stock. No damaged or shorted wires were found. During this I found the DVD player was wired into the command start wiring. I removed it as well. The draw a was gone. Again I reassembled and the draw came back. Now I had the draw even when I unhooked the cable at the under hood junction box. I disassembled and broke down the junction box. I found I had a draw for the front blower motor and rear blower motor controller. When I unhooked the motor and controller my draw went away. I removed the control wire from the front blower motor and plugged it back in. The draw was gone for about 10 seconds and returned. I unhooked the blower motor and the draw was gone. The same thing in the rear. I left them unhooked and the draw came back. Plugging them back in didn't change the draw. I now had my draw from the short bar to the four fuses that are after it. The Radio 1, CRT, ECU B, and Dome. If I unplugged all the fuses my draw was gone, but if I plugged any one fuse in the draw came back. I decided since the draw was moving I may have a grounding issue. Prior to this I unplugged the NAV (radio) unit and the dome lights, etc. I still had a draw if I plugged one of the fuses in. I also monitored it over night to make sure I wasn't just not waiting long enough. We have had the vehicle in the shop for over a week now.

I had a Sequoia that had a draw, something in the rear gate{either the window or wiper} was inoperative but was keeping the BCM powered up because it was not parked properly. Check that all you factory stuff works properly.\n\nOn this late of a model, there is very little draw allowable, usually less than 20mA after all modules shutdown. The 50mA figure is old school spec, and does not apply here. Sounds as though you have a module not shutting down.\n\nLook up the voltage drop across fuse chart. If you don't have it I can email you it. Then use your voltage meter to single out exactly which fuse has the current draw. Seems like you keep waking something up while testing. I have seen bluetooth modules wake up when getting a signal from a phone.If you never have tried it, it is the best way to locate a draw on vehicles without disturbing the modules by circuit interruption.

But I do know that the Duramax's had big problems with cracked injectors. May need to replace all of them.\n\nI hate to ask a stupid question but have you verified fuel quality? Bio diesel or gas will cause injector imbalances & knocking. Also for the smoking, make sure the MAF sensor is very clean and it doesn't have a K&N type air filter as it throws MAF sensor readings way off. and positive seven is as high as I think the FICM will bump the injector, so that one either isn't flowing or it's using that cylinder to try to balance out an adjacent firing cylinder.\n\nThe injector connector kit is for the vin 2 LLY engine and will shut down 4 injectors at a time when it trips fault. A cracked injector will smoke white at idle as it leaks during all strokes and blows raw fuel out exhaust. Your black smoke is either from combustion over fueling due to a skewed sensor of a lack of air from filter or turbo pressure."}

You may have to take the t-body off the intake but remove the fasteners and take the housing off. The gasket between the housing and the t-body fails and causes a vacuum leak and an incorrect map output.....Rosco\n\nHi Ronald, Code 26 will set if the upshift light is burnt out. It is an amber bulb located in the lower right of the instrument cluster. I remember this because I've worked on a Saturn where the PCM was replaced for a Code 26 (QDM fault) and the MIL still came back. It was the upshift bulb all along.\n\nDitto on the upshift lamp bulb, it and the EGR & EVAP solenoids are ground controlled through the ECM. The quad driver codes will set if the circuits open/short or resistance gets too high. The ECM will shut down control of the circuit for internal damage protection. The upshift lamp must be functioning. The EGR & EVP solenoids are very common issues on these cars after 90,000 miles or so. Replace them if the upshift lamp bulb does not completely cure the problem. HTH! Matt\n\nchances are that upshift light is your culprit. quad driver turns it on, if the bulb is burned out the cel will come on. i am assuming this car has a manual trans."}

It will release the brakes also, if we loosen the two nuts that hold the master cylinder to the hydro boost (about 1-2 turns on the nuts) Later discovered that slight tap on the brake pedal releases the pressure in the brake system and wheels will go free again. Symptom appeared after leaky master cylinder replacement. Since than another MC was tried, new calipers and flexible brake hoses all around, used hydro-boost. At that point we inherited the truck from the first shop. Flushed the PS fluid, tried third and fourth master cylinder, one new one used, brakes still lock-up after short drive and hard push on the brake pedal.

You can remove the master cylinder and see if the push rod moves when you start the truck. Binding brake pedal?, Binding brake switch? Incorrectly adjusted brake switch? Bad used brake booster or wrong one?\n\nA defective or incorrect hydo-boost or incorrect push rod length will cause the pedal lock up. If brake pedal is not binding on its pivot I would replace the h-b with a new GM hydro-boost or with one that included the push rod as per the application.\n\nThe hydro-booster is not returning to a full rest position or there is some mechanical interference which prevents full release.\n\nWeng, If problem started after master cyl replacement and pressure releases with bolts loosend at hydroboost,sounds like one of those would be the problem.If pressure releases with a tap on the brake pedal possibly something binding not allowing full return?Would be nice to have old parts to compare.If problem started with master would look closely at that.\n\nYes pull up the pedal when locked but make sure if it goes up some the relay rod to the booster follows. Make sure nothing is blocking the pedal return like a trailer brake system, line lock, jerk wiring or repair job or whatever. Is it possible the HB unit is staying applied because it can't bleed off the apply pressure due to a restricted hose or something?\n\nI think that you will find that the brake pedal pivot is binding/sticking, if you are able to make the brakes release with a pull up of the pedal after your moderate to hard stop.Good Luck\n\nCheck for binding in the brake pedal if you do not find any replace the booster with a new or rebuilt one.\n\nAfter realizing the brakes released when you unbolted the master cylinder from the booster, why did you try 2 more master cylinders?

The motor vac/carbon clean machines cure alot of drivability problems.\n\nBoost presure exceeded is likely a vacuum leak in one of the intake pressure lines and not a control valve. Aside from a hissing whoosh sound under boost, if you have a VAG-COM (highly recomended for VW/Audi you can likely see it in measuring block #32, fuel trim adaptation @ idle and off idle,. If your trim @ idle is adding more than say +4% (this indicates a possible vacuum leek), but the off idle value is closer to 0% (no VACUUM leak under any boost, that would be a good indicator. But first take a quick look around and see if you find any soft (split) hoses, loose clamps, tell tail oil of the sorce of leak. If you don't find anything upon visual inspection, you need to smoke check or better yet pressure test the intake for leaks. I susspect you just have a vacuum leak causing your problem.\n\nHey there, We have had a whole bunch of the concerns. We found half the time it is the fuel pump relay, which powers up the injectors & will act like the ign switch is turned off int.

Best Regards Bill\n\nHi Jason, The throttle body should have a readaption done to it after cleaning. Usually you get a code for \"Idle Adaption Exceeds Limits\" when that is the problem. If it comes back, suspect a bad ignition switch.

This email was sent in strict accordance with our membership agreement and terms of service.\n\nYou said the cam and crank where 180, this is OK, as most gears aren't correct for this. 180 is ok because at one ,180 you have compression, the next exhaust. I always crank the engine for compression stroke TDC before installing distributer, or a check for proper rotor location. If timing was off, you would not have compression.What you say doesn't add up. The thing is, someone reading this isn't going to learn from what you listed, because until you moved distributer everything else was right. So what was done, you don't say you did a chain. So why was distributer out? Your facts aren't right. If you or customer did chainOK, but the distributer was never indexed to it. That is why it didn't start, not that the 180 dots.\n\nI agree with Harold.....there is another (recent) post where the guy (tried) to pass off the SAME stuff on us....Dan H.\n\nIt (also) was a Jeep 4.0...but a '99....and it was Jon from Ill. who said the crank and cam was 180* out....yeah,RIGHT.......Dan H.\n\nFirst of all,150 lb,s across the board tells you the engine is mechanicly good.Cam timing \"WAS\"correct,remember the drive ratio is two to one.When the crank is on tdc compression stroke,the two gears are dot to dot,but as the crank makes one more round to tdc again,it is now at top of exhaust and the cam has only turned half a revolution,which is where you found it. One more turn of the crank brings the two dots back together.Remember it takes two complete revolutions of the crank to complete on full cycle. I dont know what your problem was without seeing more,but it wasn,t cam timing if the crank dot was at 12 oclock and the cam was also at 12 oclock.Every other revolution will repeat this!! This is four stroke principle 101\n\nHi Chris.. all cams turn at 1/2 crank speed, so every other revolution the cam gear will appear 180 degrees out.. Turn the crank 1 full turn & check your marks again.. When you are trying to index the dist. wad up a paper towel in the # 1 plug hole & Bump the starter, when the paper blows out then turn the crank the rest of the way to TDC by hand & Dist. is ready to be installed.. align the rotor button to where it should be & make sure the fireing pickup parts are aligned & Should be close enough to fire right up.. Hope this Helps for Next time ;>? K.P.\n\nHi Chris.. clicked \" Refresh \" & then saw Keith's Message.. I have seen some pontiac V-8's that have had the marks 180 out & been ON the compression stroke.. So I Learned a Long time ago Not to trust the cam gear marks for dist placement... SHTH ;>? K.P.\n\nThe only question that remains is whether the spark is strong enough.Good luck.\n\nHi Chris, When @ tdc you should have dot to dot. But to verify bring crank to tdc. Cam dot will be in time(dot to dot)and distributor rotor at #1 on cap. OR crank at tdc and cam 180 out(like you wrote) AND distributor rotor 180 out. I believe it is in time. You should check injector pulse and fuel quality/contamination. Good Luck, Dennis Durand Swansea,Ma."}

I deal with them every day, good ones like Toyota extra care, GMPP, MIC, MPP, Chrysler extended Care, to name a few, never want you to put in a used unit, as you can see, this is risky business. DO NOT MAKE THESE HALF-ASSED COMPANIES PROBLEMS, YOURS!

In the event that they insist that I put in the used trans, I make the warranty co. secure the trans, provide their own shipping, so there is no doubt as to who's responsibility this used trans is. I also discuss with the warranty co.what they do when this unit fails, what they pay to re-install, if they pay me storage while they jerk me & the customer around, etc. have them put it in writing, & fax it to me. I let the customer know all of this, so they know that it is not me jerking them around! Anyone with a '98 Volvo, indeed any car that they want to hang on to, should want it fixed right, and are foolish if they accept the used trans, and are just as culpable as the half-baked warranty co. at that point, and if they then get jerked around they are getting what THEY asked for, JUST MAKE IT CLEAR FROM THE START THAT THE USED TRANS OPTION IS USUALLY A BAD ONE,AND YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH IT, AND YOU WILL NOT, IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT, I have had foolish customers & warranty co.s put in 3 or 4 used units that either failed on the lift, or shortly thereafter, and even with all of my warnings to the contrary, they wind up resenting ME for it.

After I kept releasing the adjustment, and still dragging, I took the wheel off, and the drum was very lose on the brake shoes.

Bolt the drums on with the lug nuts and turn the drums several times, then take them off and look for witness marks. It might help to put paint on the likely interference surfaces if the first try doesn't show you what's contacting. I don't like the idea of using brake shoes that \"grab better\" than OE, especially on rear brakes. A lot of aftermarket brake shoe friction compounds caused performance problems on both front and rear wheel GM vehicles back then - too \"grabby\". Good luck - hope this helps.\n\nI agree with Phil..sounds like the shoes are too wide and when the lug nuts torgue down, it causes them to drag on the drum face OR forces them into the backing plate..is the backing plate and backing plate contact area in the drum nice and clean?....I too dont like the \"grabby\" shoes on these old beasts.\n\nI also agree. There has to be something getting jammed when you tighten the wheel nuts and the most likely candidate is the shoes are probably too wide. This is another thing where you may have too much of a good thing and that is the grabby shoes. The ABS may help make them a little more acceptable, but why introduce addl problems to a system that did the job.\n\n20 year old drums are probably not holding the torque,flexing in at the center.\n\nMatch up the old brake shoes with the new ones, I'm sure you'll find your problem\n\nAlmost sounds like the shoes are too wide and catch on the edge of the shoe when you tighten it down. Did you check for that? I don't think your problem is from the shoes being adjusted too tightly. I think you should look for something else to do with the brakes dragging, such as what I mentioned above.\n\nI had that same problem on a cadillac years ago it was the brake shoes, I would try a different set of shoes.\n\nI had that same problem on a cadillac years ago it was the brake shoes, I would try a different set of shoes.\n\ni think brake shoes are to wide good luck\n\nWould agree that most likely the brake shoes are incorrect BUT you ought to be able to look at the inside of the drum and/or the edge of the shoes and see where it's scraping if it's the shoe width that's the problem. The only other issue may be corrosion built up on the hub that's causing the drum to warp when it's tightened down. Maybe a light coat of black spray-can paint on the inside of the drum could help ID the contact point (wipe back off with brake cleaner when you're done). HTH\n\nHii Alfiero Sounds like the new shoes are to wide check the width of the old ones compared to the new ones been there done this before good luck\n\nI'd try new shoes. We don't use WBR shoes anymore because of fitment issues like this, and because of excessive dusting.\n\nShoes probably too wide. Compare them to the original ones.\n\nSounds like the edge of shoes need to be beveled I do it to all of my shoes just so I don't gotta go back I even bevel the front and rear so it has a smoother transition while braking\n\nCould the brake shoes be a tad to wide. measure the old ones for width. Seems everything else has been looked at. Maybe re install the one side of old set of shoes adjust like new and torque the wheel. Does the same thing happen? if not then the new shoes have a problem.Hope this helps\n\nHi, would have to agree with everyone else that the shoes are too wide, maybe not the linings but the webbing it self. Good luck, Andy\n\nAs the others say too wide brake shoes. But Phil could be right if the edges are pulling up. Could there just be so much rust on the drum and backing plate? Are the axle flanges or backing plates bent?\n\nare the shoes too wide ? or produced wrong. compare to old shoes for size and be sure wheel cylinders are correct size.\n\nSounds like you have the wrong shoes- they are too wide. As you tighten down the wheel the drum presses on the edge of the shoes and will lock it up. Measure the width of the old shoes and compare.\n\nTry a different set of shoes\n\nShim the drums [use some washers] on each stud and tighten drums down and see if it helps. At least you would know if the shoes are contacting the backing plates. DO NOT LEAVE THE WASHERS ON THE STUDS, PERMANENTLY.\n\nLook in the drum, if you see a shoulder where the drum isn't machined back to the drum face its machined wrong! That shoulder needs cut out so the entire area is flat, I've seen this several times. The only other things it can be is either wrong ( too wide) or poorly manufactured shoes!\n\nFirst make sure your lathe cut to the bottom of the drum. Then install new rivited name brand shoes.Make sure you can slap shoes side to side to center.Then grind a small amount of lining off outside edge of shoes.If vechicle does not stop good, most stopping power is on the front.hope this helps\n\nAs stated above, need to find out where/how they are dragging. If only one side, I was thinking maybe cracked drum. If both and didn't do it before, likely bad tolerance on parts.\n\nEither the shoes are wrong width or thickness. The park brake cable could be hanging up also. Are the shoes against the pivot pin at top? If they are not the cable or cables are stuck.\n\ndouble check the width of the new brake shoes,they might be slightly wider then the old ones and causing the shoes to drag on the drums when the wheels are tightened up\n\nEverybody is assuming original wheels; If they are aftermarket, it may be necessary to use a 1/8 or even 1/4 spacer between hub and rim; I've even found this on OEM wheels from a different year than the vehicle. At least it's a cheap experiment, to help narrow down the problem.\n\nOn rare occasions I have incurred this on multiple types of vehicles. Every time the drum was dragging on the edge of the brake shoe. Another set of shoes fixed them all.\n\ntry putting the drum on different studs and see if it helps. axle flange or drum center maybe off.\n\nAlfiero, Agree sounds like I would match old shoes w new.\n\nTry putting new brake hardware; springs, pins and all the other parts that come in a kit.\n\nGlad it ended well. Hint: check your spelling so that no one is offended.\n\nMakes me wonder if there is a left and right with those shoes. That could account for the 'web' being off-center, if I'm reading your thoughts correctly."}

If you don't have voltage at pin 17, load test powers and grounds at PCM.\n\nHi Kenny,Looking at a schematic, I would want to know if the PCM could produce good voltage at pin 17 connector X1 (yell wire), if the PCM can produce good voltage there unhooked, I would then measure the voltage at PCM, the relay and the starter with everything connected. It is possible there is a poor connection or voltage drop present.If the PCM is not able to produce the correct voltage, I would be checking the powers and grounds in to it. Good luck with it.Sam\n\nkenny, push putton! i would start there put it back to stock.\n\nI had one of these. Put a volt meter on the battery and watch it whilst you're trying to crank it over. The one I worked on the battery voltage would drop down to 8v at times then I'd look and it would be 12v. I tested it with a Midtronics and it passed. So I load tested a few times and the voltage would drop to 10v then 9v then I'd let the battery sit for a minute and the voltage would go back to 12v. I've been at this since 1972 and I've never had a battery do this. ~Cheers~\n\nvoltage drop as the last tech mentioned what is battery doing ,what is voltage at starter\n\nVoltage drop test the power and ground circuits at the ECM connectors and the relay.A bad connection at the fuse block connector or ECM can cause this.The BCM is the ignition mode master and it sends a serial data message to the ECM for crank request so monitor the data as well.\n\nhas to be a voltage drop, i agree with what out5hers have said\n\nOhms law still applies to a Sonic or any other car.I have 30 years experience and told you to monitor BCM ignition mode data while you are cranking to see if the crank request stays on.I will not try to help you again.I am a GM Master Tech and have worked on these Daewoo cars.\n\nI understand the desire for vehicle specific help, but many times that is not available.Is there any chance of a scope capture/file? If you are not sure how to upload a file and link it I could run you through the process.I would still like to see out of the ecm, at the fuse box and at the starter. The newer vehicle fuse boxes are of a low quality and fail often.If all three of these voltages are very close, most likely there is a input problem to the ecm. Seems unlikely that a new ecm would be defective, but that is also a possibility.Good luck, Sam\n\nKenny,Here is a link to a Sonic forum with a no crank concern.

This particular car has a Mercedes Benz tranny 722.635 which we have rebuilt many and we know the transmission is good, we even took the valve body out and replaced the solenoids and both turbine speed sensors. Now, I got 2 questions for you guys: does the speedo on this Jag take speed info from the ABS module like the Benz does? if so, I know what to look for next. Does anyone know FOR SURE? not guessing, Alldata, Mitchell 5, and Autodata have very poor diagrams on this system and I hate to pay $200 to use manufacturers website. Second question: The wheel speed sensors on this car are OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE, has anyone found a cheap replacement for them (like Ford, MBZ, or any other sensor that might work?

BTW, its usually the harness not the sensor if it does come down to sensor issues. Jag was smart enough to make the harness relaceable. I do believe the primary speed data is sent accross the CAN network from the ABS module. However, if the data is missing it will calculate from other sources.\n\nDitto what Brian said. I've had a lot of Jags with bad harnesses going to the wheel speed sensors.\n\nThese vehicles do get their speed information from abs module. Wheel speed sensors rarely fail,the harnesses are the bits that fail. Abs faults also can be from pump motor failure due to dry soldered joints at pump wiring on circuit board in module.Easy fix with 1\" hole saw at back of pump terminals ,resolder and plug hole with a grommet.$$$$ saved. You must hook up a scan tool that can interface with these vehicles otherwise you are flying blind.Launch are not good with these sort of situations.\n\ncan U communicate w/abs_tcs?? what codes do U have??\n\nI can let you know a far more convenient place to get the circuit diagrams if you tell me your email addy.\n\nwhat codes did you retreive from abs computer and what diagnostic computer are you using.paul\n\nOscar,Check torque of rear axle nuts.I have had 2 cars with a loose nut & then the abs ring spins freely at times.John\n\nIt gets the speed signal from the abs. Most of the time the fly lead going to the sensor goes bad and it is not that much. very easy to test just disconnect it at the sensor and then in the engine compartment and then ohm out the wires.\n\nOscar, On the questionable ABS module, I have had a bad one or few and BBA Reman fixes them for less than $200. I was told that if a unit that came from another car was put on it had to be programmed so that is a benefit of having the original unit repaired. I got the idea that this is a common problem. The unit can be removed without opening brake fluid lines also. Hope this helps some.\n\nHi Oscar, harness link leads were problematic, wish u well, Rob"}

(The locks are not pulled down and the pump does not activate as our MOD information indicates it should.)And the second part of the test Quote; (cannot perform this one because we fail the first) 1)After the first test pulls all the locks down again and the pump runs, wait 15 seconds and pull all 4 locks up again in succession.

Does the controller apply vacuum w/a single control solinoid or does it have multiple solinoids for the various doors inside the controller?

Ive replaced the waterpump and thermostat again just to make sure the waterpump was right it has r stamped on the impeller and the water pump is turning counter clockwise. I took the heater hose off the thermostat housing and started the jeep up and no water will come out the hose unless I give it 1500 or so rpm. I called jasper and told them everything we have tried,so they sent another engine, we installed it still running 230- 240 going down the road. the electric fan is working and the clutch fan is good both fans are pulling air very good and the a/c condenser is clean.it has a winch bumper on it so we took it off and put a piece of tin in the place were the bumper went to make sure air was going threw the radiator.i looked at the jasper engine that we pulled out thinking headgasket installed wrong but it wasn't. the only thing I seen was the engine had .075 piston stamped on top. im going to try this morning bypassing the heater core because I read on another iatn post the heater core hoses can get crossed and make it run hot, not sure about that but at this point anything is possible.i was wondering it seems like the heater hose should be pumping water at idle to because if not the heater would blow cold at idle. And can these engines be bored .075 and not build heat the cooling system cant get rid of.I took the center out of the thermostat and just put the outside ring of the thermostat back in and ran it it cooled down to about 224 degrees and ive tried 180 and 195 degree thermostats no difference. thanks for any help don't no what to do next", "output": "Shipping cap/plug not removed from replacement radiator???...I've read of that happening....maybe a bogus radiator....install the old one and see if it works any better.(as a test)...That \"R\" has me wondering, too....Dan Habluetzel....South Texas...\n\nSerpentine belt ...or...V-Belt ???...Serp's usually are counter-rotators...maybe you got a V- type pump...just a thought....Dan Habluetzel....again...\n\n...and...as a side note ...thermostats control MINIMUM operating temps...note: A wide open 160\u00b0 stat is NO MORE wide open than a wide open 195\u00b0 stat is...why would it make an \"overheater\" NOT overheat (still)...just so you know....Dan H.\n\nHad this problem before and it turned out to be the heater core was clogged, and the radiator was clogged as well due to using that dex cool that the customer used.Just a thought.\n\nAre you sure you've got the belt on correct? It is possible to have the belt on the wp backwards and still achieve belt tension.\n\nI called Mr. MoPar parts monkey in the adjacent town and he said there are two different pumps shown for a '96 Jeep 4.0L(one CCW and one CW)...I'd bet you have the wrong one on your's... after that conversation....but remember ...he's a parts monkey....Dan H....one mo time...\n\nI'm on board with wrong water pump, fought this problem a few times myself, at this point I would try the other possibility, what do you have to lose. Good luck.\n\nCCW is correct rotation.I usually fill these with Temp sender out until they flow out the hole & then put sender back.This seems to help eliminate air pockets.Had one with a rag caught in the hose from expansion tank that gave the same problem.\n\nThere has to be something plugged up if the belt routing and water pump are correct! I would first order both water pumps and compare them to insure the correct one is used in this application. At that point blow air through each of the hoses to make sure they're open. If this has a mechanical fan reve the engine while standing in front and verify the air is being pulled through the radiator and not pushed backwards through it because of belt routing or wrong fan blade ( I've seen it!). Let us know what you find, good luck\n\n98% chance wrong water pump... 2% chance the lower hose is full of stop-leak, a rag, or a shipping plug. Jeep 4.0's usually insist on a vacuum coolant fill. Blocking off the heater hoses will guarantee an overheat; there MUST be circulation through that circuit for the thermostat to open, and remaining air to purge. Wrong water pump from a previous repair might be the root cause of overheat/head gasket failure.I'm currently driving an '89 with 290,xxx miles on it as my daily beater, so I've had some practice.\n\nTry another water pump. Make sure you have the correct belt routing. Coolant should flow from heater hoses even at a dead idle.\n\nI am thinking you have a possible have a water pump issue or a heater core issue. I would check your new pump against the original to see if it has the proper impeller . Also bypass the heater core or try flushing it with a garden hose and see what kind of flow you have\n\nHad an issue similar to yours. Check the water pump impeller. The one I changed impeller was cracked in half. I just slapped in a new one and yes it was the wrong water pump.good luck\n\nAre you sure the pistons are marked .075, and not 0.75, which would be the metric equivalent of .030\".\n\nTry another water pump\n\nTry matching the blades of the new pump against the old one. If you don't have the old pump just call the dealer and order one per vin. Also remove lower radiator hose and the radiator should empty out in less than 3 seconds if it's flowing good\n\npull some hoses and check water pump flow if good then look for a blockage in the new radiator\n\nI've seen similar issues with these. Both times the wrong water pump was the problem. When they switched to serpentine belts the pump direction was reversed. Perhaps that was the root cause of the earlier failure.\n\nI shouldn't find your dilemma funny, but I do.Every time I hear Jasper I cringe. Also every time I here about the 4.0L water pump issue I am reminded of when the CW vs. CCW change was made.Back then if you did not purchase new pumps some rebuilders didn't know the difference and craps, what a mess.Now when I hear Jasper I am reminded again.I can still remember the Chrysler tech line telling me that I didn't purge the system correctly.Before I forget, do a flow test of the heater hoses to be certain that you have strong circulation, both into an out of the core.Anyway, I hope this solves your problem.\n\ntry this on the drivers side at the rear of the engine head there is a temp sensor or a plug remove the sensor or plug start engine till coolant come out, temp on those engines generally run higher temps\n\nThinking wrong water pump or a restricted radiator, maybe from those radiator plugs which come on the new radiator.\n\nHi Jamie, Think of your cooling system comprised of three components. Engine cooling jacket, radiator and heater loop. Each part can be tested for flow with a garden hose one component at a time. If there is low flow in one of three or more you know it will overheat. You will get the feel of how much flow to experience with the garden hose flowing. Be sure to reclaim any coolant before you start the process. BMW coolant is good to run after a thorough flush and chase with 100 PSI compressed air. The engine runs clockwise when facing the vibration dampner. Any pulley with the belt on the bottom or on the left will automatically turn CCW. The water pump belt is on the left and it will turn CCW. Good Luck, Gary\n\nWatch the aftermarket radiators could be your issue\n\nI used to own a 1995 XJ Cherokee with a 4.0 engine when I worked at a Jeep dealer a few years ago and had a similar problem with mine....after repeated flushing of the complete system,heater core and 2 different stock replacement radiators I went to my local Car Quest store and ordered an \"extreme duty\" 3 row radiator...may have been 2 but it had double the rows of cooling tubes the stock one had.Problem was solved and no further issues....Also fixed 2 mail route Wranglers with similar problems by doing thatTim Terry Jacks 5 Star Clinic Inc.

Also, be sure that the boost pressure sensor is working great and the car is actually building boost .

The other thing is the spark plugs are due about now we get a lot of out of range type codes because they are trying to compensate for the worn plugs.\n\nI've replaced a few intake manifold gaskets on older 6-cyl Volvos.

Sorry more questions than answers with the info you provided. Mark\n\nIt sounds normal to me. If you turn on all the accessories on almost any vehicle at idle it can't keep up and drops to battery voltage. By raising the rpm you enable the alternator to run at full capacity. Are you having any other problems? Battery light lit on dash? .....\n\nHi Mike, If it charges above idle it is probably normal. Have you checked for a loose belt, sometimes they will cause that as well. Try it for a few days and see if it all works out OK. Bob\n\nMike based on the numbers you are giving us that sounds normal- it is very possible to only see 12.5v at idle fully loaded. What type of issue are you having with the car that prompted the alternator replacement? Greg and crew\n\nWhat are the \"voltage drop\" readings of the circuit under load? This should identify the source of the condition.\n\nMike, You may not have as much of a problem as you think. As the other techs said, 12.5 volts at idle with several accessories on is normal. What I have found on many Audis is that there is a significant voltage drop on the positive wire to the battery under load. It sometimes has several connections with corresponding resistance. I usually add an additional wire directly from the B+ terminal on the alternator to the posotive terminal of the battery. One 10 guage wire will usually do the trick and insure good current feed to the battery. Route the wire so it doesn't interfere with anything. Hope this helps.\n\nI think you will find your problem in the PCM.As you know,when full power is demanded by the operator,the PCM detects this and shuts off any high demand power assessories including the battery charging so as to get full bhp from the engine.Your problem is,I think,that the PCM is regulating this feature at the wrong times and I think you should check this section out.\n\nCheck the voltage regulator, it might be faulty, I had a similiar problem. The alternator sounds like it works fine since it shows that it is putting out 14v at times, that is what the alternator should be putting out. The voltage regulator does just that, it regulates how much voltage the alternator is to put out, and it sounds like its shorting out when under a load, and its inexpensive, around $10.\n\nI don't know if this will help, but years ago in Phoenix, Arizona, we discovered that Audi Turbos would run down the battery in three hours or so in very hot weather. The problem was that the alternators did not have the amperage rating to supply enough currant when everything was running in hot conditions. At first, we sent the alternators out to be re-wound for higher amperage, then Audi supplied higher rated alternators. That fixed the problem.\n\nThis might sound stupid, but did you check how the serpentine belt is routed and is it the correct lenght.\n\neither the drive belt around the alternator is slipping or the alternator has a phase out or you have a voltage drop bettween the batt post on the alternator and the battery\n\nI am feeling as though the gentleman who suggested checking the p.c.m. is right. These systems are dependant on control via the p.c.m. and ought to be checked. The thing to do would be to find out what the volatages should be, when at an idle. If it's wrong, I would see about fault tracing the p.c.m.\n\nIf you install a new cluster on the early A6 it does have to be coded properly (4 or 6 cyl. etc.), but there are also some adaptations that have to be carried out. If these are not done you can have lots of problems.\n\nMike ,does the alternator pulley have the one way sprag on it? i have seen problems with these pulleys slipping in the past"}

By left shaft, I'm assuming you mean the shaft at the front of the car. When you line up the mark on the shaft pulley (at about 11 o'clock), don't worry about using the 6mm pin in the hole (the exhaust is usually in the way, anyways). When the mark is lined up, simply move the pulley slightly off the mark. If the balance weight is at the right spot, the shaft will try to move back to the index mark. If it tries to roll further away from the index, rotate the shaft one revolution, then repeat moving the shaft slightly off the mark; it will try to move back to the mark. The extra step in the timing marks is due to the gear ratio difference in the oil pump drive. The rear shaft is simply lined up with the mark (about 9 o'clock). Cams, crank are as in the manual. Also, don't forget to use www.hmaservice.comfor the factory manual information. Also, check to see the upper belt cover is updated; the new one will have a \"bump\" on the inside of the cover to help keep the belt from jumping time. You may also want to take a close look at the crank sensor and reluctor plate to see if there has been any contact. These have been a problem occasionally, with the CKP failing and the motor stops running. While the belt is off is the time to check it. Finally, check the TSB 03-20-002 for a crank bolt update. Some torque loss can allow the pulley, reluctor and sprocket to move around, wrecking the crank, reluctor and sprocket.\n\nChris, Richard nailed it. Make sure to replace the balance shaft belt and auto tensioner also, verify that the wiring for the crank sensor is tucked out of the way of the T-Belt to prevent rub through, and don't over-tighten the balance shaft belt. The balance shaft belt should have approximately 10mm of \"slack\". If it is too tight it will cause it to \"walk\" wearing it out very quickly and possibly causing severe damage. After it is all reassembled you will need to turn the motor over 6 times by hand for all of the marks to line back up correctly and verify correct timing. Good luck, these aren't too bad once you've done a few.\n\nChris, The balance shaft is driven at a 2:1 ratio through the oil pump. Simply remove the belt, rotate the oil pump gear one full turn and refit the belt. Screwdiver will now enter the hole. Regards, Brian"}

In Oregon, we do not have self service, a gas attendant must fill your tank, I asked if he was topping or not, and he stated the he tells then not to top the tank. One last thing, the car is the sedan, not the station wagon model.", "output": "Check it with a smoke machine if you have one.\n\nAny exhuast leaks? Smoke evap system.No mention of checking for codes,bad cat maybe.\n\ncheck all fuel hose clamps under the hood especially where hoses connect to rail. tighten all clamps.\n\nCheck REAL close at the fuel line conection at the left forward area of the fuel tank lines near the left rear suspention. The plastic \"quik-connects\" get goffy in the cold weather. It's where they go into the body.\n\nGo around and tighten all fuel line clamps.\n\nOk there really isnt a fix and its not the only car line out there suffering from it. but at temps I think around 18 degrees or colder with some moistuere in the air either when the temp hits this or before hand moisture freezes in the fuel tanks vent system. As a result the fuel vaoprs that are being moved around after start up as the tank vents which is actually quite a bit of expansion as the fuel lines start running around the engine and bring fuel temps up a lot. This Allows all of this to move out of the vent system without being filtered. I see a dozen of these every time we get below 20 degrees and its been moist out. One other place to check is any rubber fuel lines ( especially return lines) at the intake manifold I have heard of several leaking in cold weather. I had a Nissan in on Friday that had a very wet fuel line at the intake when I drove it in cold. After it warmed up the sweating went away. I put a new line on it.\n\nSounds like an evap issue. If you have a smoke machine, smoke it when it's cold. You may have a purge valve sticking closed not allowing it to vent.\n\nI have a 03 forester that my wife drives. we have the same problem with it. I have checked about everything you have and not found any thing no leaks or nothing. I am still looking and if i find the problem i will let you know. or if you find the problem let me know.\n\nI have been fighting this problem on my own car for 6 years. the only way I can beat it is by adjusting the fuel line clamps every year at the begining of winter. I have a few customers that I do the same thing on. I think it is a engine vibration/frequency problem that keeps loosing the clamps just enough and at zero deg cold start due to the different metal's and rubber expansions rates it creats a very slight seep for a few seconds. I am going to convert to all metal lines next year if I get time just for fun. but I have also heard the injector seals shrink also so who knows.\n\nHi Jeff, Very common on these cars. Two short fuel line on both sides of the engine in front of the injector rails. After letting it sit outside over night start the car @ wiggle or put pressure on these lines and you will see them leak. the fuel lines get hard @ crack. good luck John\n\nI had a similar problem with a Rue.I could not get a hc reading anywhere.The smell would come and go.I finally took the filler neck off and cleaned it. There were several small pin holes in it ,replaced it and all is well.\n\nCHECK endwench.com and look for arcilves on wrx fuel smell when cold I replaced the sube cheep clamps with good screw worm clamps and solved the problems without geting the kit. you may have the same problem on the outback. It only leaks when very cold.\n\nWe generally find one or more loose fuel line clamps under the hood in really cold weather. Look closely at the fuel rail by #1 & #3 injectors. The other common leak is by the fuel filter."}

Great customer has done all recommended maintenance since new. Head gasket has been leaking small amount of oil for past 30K, recently started showing signs of coolant leak(stain, crusty coolant). Customer was on fence on whether to fix or not so took car. 3 weeks later customer called and said temp gauge was 1 line from red. Vehicle came in and we verified low coolant and active leak from head gasket. Customer approve head gasket replacement. Had heads pressure tested and machined. Replaced head gaskets and thermostat as well as timing belt. Vehicle still has overheating concern, runs fine on highway, at slower speeds temp climbs steadily even with cooling fans both running. Shut down vehicle around 230-235 and allow to cool. Limp back to shop. Since this point we have: Performed chemical hydrocarbon test - negative results Replaced thermostat again with Subaru part Replaced radiator with new part Replace water pump Re-torqued head as recommended by our local machine shop Removed heads and replaced gaskets with Felpro head gasketsWhen we remove the new head gaskets the ring around cylinder #4 had a raised spot on both side like a small piece of debris was stuck between the layers so we thought for sure we had it fixed.We have tried both the Subaru bleeding procedure as well as an air-lift vacuum for the cooling system with no change.After each repair vehicle was road tested and same symptom every time. With vehicle in shop cooling fans come on at about 214-215 and go off at 208 after fully warmed up.We have never had this kind of problem with a Subaru before and are completely puzzled by why it is happening.Any and all help would be greatly apprieciated", "output": "Some of my questions might be basic but not all info was provided so bear with me.Do cooling fans come on at specified temp,was water pump replaced?Do have adequate coolant flow in radiator[may be clogged].Is there hot and cool spots across radiator[check with infared temp gun],Coolant temp sensor also is switch for fans maybe that was compromised with initial overheating episode.Just some suggestions to lead you in right direction.\n\nHave you checked heater core for blockage?\n\nIt is likely that the original overheat caused silicate from the coolant to drop out and coat the inner surfaces of the radiator tubes. It is an excellent heat insulator and can only be removed by chemical bath. Most techs replace the radiator for this problem if it's Aluminum.Regards, Keith\n\nWe had same issue not long ago and found if you follow the cooling circuit on the vehicle (not info in Alldata), it must pass through the heater core for proper circulation. We replaced the heater core and everything was fine afterwards.\n\nI've had issues bleeding subaru cooling systems in the past. Lift just the front end up after warmed up. With vehicle off undo one of the heater hose clamps and let coolant run out a little. They get air pockets in the heater core\n\nDidn't see any mention of your pressure testing the cooling system. I'd also check the overflow hose for cracks, if it can expel fluid but can't suck it back in, in short order its low on coolant. Also recommend putting a new STANT cap on it and/or pressure testing the old one. Sounds stupid, but make sure fans are spinning correct direction. Subaru had a Yuuuge! problem getting head gaskets to seal and for awhile gave out tins of ground up walnut shells to put into the coolant. Hydrocarbon tests are iffy; the (blue, NAPA) reactant quickly goes bad ON THE SHELF. Need to test it with the C02 from your breath before using.\n\ntry bypassing the heater core as a test.just put the hoses together and see whay you get it could be the core.\n\nSubaru cooling system splits in two halves through the crossover pipe and must be filled from upper hose to avoid air pocket. Test the system with the thermostat removed to confirm the status .\n\nHello , What doesn't make sense to me is that its ok at highway speeds? That would indicate a airflow problem (plenty of air at highway speed). restriction problem should be worse at highway speeds. I guess make sure fans are running high speed and/or up to speed. One other thought is to check temperature difference head to head while its running hot with infrared Good LuckDaniel Salvatore\n\nHave you tried bypassing the heater core. From memory the bypass when thermostat is closed is via heater core\n\nchemical test is not accurate, use a gas analyzer instead. it is much,much accurate than chemical. next, hook the scan tool and compare it with the temperature gauge. sometime you have a false coolant sensor or sensor coated with sediment ot corrosion\n\nEven though you're getting what looks like a good flow of water through the heater core, it's very likely restricted. This is VERY common on the dual zone systems. The passenger side air will be noticeably cooler than the driver's side with the heat on. (As you described).\n\nsounds like a air pocket. try bleeding the system with the heater hose removed so you get all the air out.\n\nIt seems that by bypassing the heater core you have confirmed the diagnosis.Why then would it run hot at lower speeds but not on the highway? Perhaps the restriction in the core is such that at higher RPM, when the pump-discharge pressure increases, the core flow is sufficient.To test this theory, you could run the car in a lower gear at a road speed at which the car would run hot.\n\nThe smallest leak (in the heater core) will result in loss of system pressure. Perhaps it only leaks once it warms up. Suggest U Warm car up with radiator cap off and THEN pressure test it. Unpressurized coolant can boil, and the cooling system no longer works as designed. Result: Overheating. Once it's boiling, big pockets of water vapor DISPLACE coolant in the heater core, so you lose heat. It also forces coolant out into the overflow, and once THAT overflows, onto the ground. Out on the highway, where you don't see it. So now the system is underfilled. Have you got wet carpets, yukky coolant film on inside of windshield (from defrost), any indications of leaking heater core other than lack of heat?\n\nBecause the heater core circuit is vital to the proper flow of coolant in the system. Some vehicles do not have an issue with this, as the core circuit is an 'adjunct' to the system, and is not part of the total flow.To determine a core that is restricted is rather easy. Just measure the temp difference between the two hoses. There should be very little difference, just a few degrees. This signifies that all the tubes are open in the core. As more tubes become restricted, the flow is lessened, resulting in a reduced surface area for heat transfer, and the remaining tubes get too much transfer. The result is a cold core, because it has less internal volume.Example: original core has 200 tubes, and this is the designed surface area for maximum airflow, with good heat transfer. Half the tubes are plugged, resulting in much more heat loss for the open tubes, thus one hose colder than the other. Incidentally, you can also use this method for checking radiators."}

Without codes and accurate diagnostics it can be real expensive to guess. Could be a bunch of things, just need more information.\n\nHello John,The warning light will always be on if you put it in inspection mode.First I would check other modules for codes. If the triangle of death came on there has to be a code. Also check oil level and the 12V battery.Hope this helpsSeiko\n\nI have had a few with driveabilty problems after tbody work due to debris in the maf-make sure nothing fell onthe hot wire in the maf when you put it back together\n\nHey JohnAre we talking orange turtle light or the red triangle? Can you communicate with the HV battery ECU? If so, check datastream: if the PID for \"delta SOC\" is greater than 20%, the HV battery is degraded and will need to be replaced. The owner may choose to wait until the red triangle appears along with corresponding codes (P3006) but they should prepare for that to happen in the near future. If delta SOC is normal (20%), the turtle light is likely coming on b/c the HV battery is hot. Check the fan (left side of trunk area). What's the weather in NC these days? Any chance they've got a blanket or a pile of beanie babies over the inlet vent (shelf above rear seat)?Best of luck, c\n\nI use the SNAPON SOLUS ULTRA and I am able to go into modules other than ECM or TCM. It sounds like you may have a VSA (Vehicle Steering Angle) issue possibly. I wish I could plug into your Prius to confirm this. I had a vehicle like this the other day. I did the VSA reset by keeping the steering straight....being on perfectly level ground....and VSA resetting. The TRiangle with \"!\" in it disappeared and the steering angle was reset. THis usually is lost if there is a battery disconnect or a traction issue. I hope this helps. God bless.\n\nThere have been some good suggestions so far John. I would add that you should check the oil level. I had a customer with significantly higher mileage (250k) and she never checked the oil level and was always well over normal service interval. The warning would come up in the infotainment screen along with the beeping, but only for 1 second while going around a corner. Turned out out to have 1 quart or less of engine oil.\n\nSurprised you don't have any codes. Those HV battery voltages don't move much by the way. They typically stay about the same voltage from 30-60% SOC. If you were suspicious about the battery, take a movie with the scanner and go load the battery; floor it going uphill or something. If random modules start dropping off on accel or spike high when braking hard, there's a problem. Oh yea, you could check the ABS controller for HV related codes too. I agree with C about the possible overheating. Clear the beanie baby shelf and check the ducting; possible mouse nest?\n\nPlease be specific. Please describe the exact appearance of the lamp in question.\n\ni agree with most of the replies need to know which light is comming on also if you would have a hv battery going south on you you would have supporting codes also sometimes not being able to get any codes from one or more system only means that that system is off line it can still cause problems and you just cant read it, an easy way to check that is look for data in any of the systems you are checking for codes if you can get data you can get codes if there is none then there is none, on that vintage the steering angle reset may or may not set a code it is easy to do so do it to rule it out even if you had an mg2 problem you should have a code for it however if the problem is mechanical then no code will show all the trany is , is two motors with final drive and planetary unsles it causes a short in the motor windings no code also you could drain the oil in the trans and look for stuff that does not belong therethese are just thoughts based on your info\n\nIf you have red triangle,you have a fault code. A problem in a number of systems can set the main warning light. Must do a scan on every system abs and so on. Check h/v cooling fan for fluf and check h/v temp , if h/v battery over heats it can drop power. A quick check is if the fan is on strong(hear it at the rear seat).or the h/v cooling sys pump will do same, does the A/c shut down when faulting.hopefully this small 2 cents can help.....you need codes..."}

Was so bad customer had the car towed in. We confirmed the smoke was engine oil by it's color and smell. When the car is started cold there is no smoke until it starts to warm up. If you then rev the engine a couple times it will put out smoke and continue to smoke as long as you let it idle. And it's a lot. At a steady 1500 rpm I thought the fire dept might be stopping by as you could hardly see my building. Removed spark plugs which all were clean. Looked at pistons with bore scope and they are all clean and evenly lightly coated with brown carbon. Removed exhaust pipe at turbo and hoses at inner cooler. All is dry there, ruling out a turbo failure. We ran the car for about a half hour hoping oil fouling would show up but when we pulled the plugs all still looks clean in spite of the smoking. Took off the valve cover and looked at the valve seals which looked intact. Checked crank case pressure which is acceptable and the PCV is sucking what feels to be about the right amount of air volume. There is no oil leaking down the hose which goes back to the air boot at the turbo inlet. Oil level is correct and clean by the way. So we decided to take off the head and inspect the valve guides closer as something obviously broke and changed from all ok to smoking in a moments time. While taking off the head we noticed oil in the intake manifold, heavier on #3 runner where the PCV sucks it's vacuum from directly above it. Which brings us back to the breather but what? There is a baffle in the valve cover which is intact and appears to be there to stop oil from going into the inlet of the pcv fitting. With the Fitting out of the valve cover and the engine running it isn't spitting any oil out. Just a little blow by but not excessive. Well by the time we saw the intake the head was almost off so we finished removing it and found everything to be pretty nice, including newer valve stem seals. The head looks like it has been off within the last few years even though our cust has only had this car six months. I wish now we had run the car much longer with the PCV out of the VC to see if the smoking was less but hindsight is 20-20. We are replacing the VS seals and putting the head back on now, convinced the problem lies elsewhere, but where?Does this scenario ring a bell with any of you Saab guys?We are totally baffled at this point.Thanks", "output": "check for a restriction at the air inlet to the filter housing. this can cause a vacuum to be drawn in the air intake boot and may suck oil in through the breather Try running it with the air filter housing open and see if it still smokes.\n\nIt's almost always the turbo. It can leak oil into the intake, or into the exhaust. Just because you don't see oil on the exhaust side, doesn't mean the oil isn't leaking into the intake. The amount of smoke, and the rapid onset of the problem, are pretty classic symptoms. Good luck, Dave\n\nIt has been awhile but, there is a black plastic box in the PCV system that has some sort of valve in it that goes bad and allows oil to be sucked up and burned. Call the SAAB dealer, it is a common fault and they stock them.\n\nhas anybody checked the pcv valve? if it allows turbo pressure thru it will suck oil into the intake\n\ntwo things can happen one is the turbo. pop off the intake tube and wiggel the shaft if it is loose that is your issue two pull all the plugs is #1 cyl wet the others dry? the head gasket breaks bettween the timing chain galley and the # 1 cyl. on the intake stroke it pulss oil in sortt wants to go back to its two stroke roots good luck\n\nIts the TURBO. The oil seal on the exhaust side is bad leaking oil directly into the exhaust, Very common. If the engine was burning that much it would foul the spark plugs. Put the head back on and replace the turbo.\n\nstill think it is the turbo, did you check the intercooler for oil?\n\nfirst of all, did you check for impeller play when you dropped the headpuipe? It still sounds like turbo...The only other thing with the pcv is if the vacuum check valve is blown out- one way check valve to stop pressureizing the crankcase under boost- in the vacuum purge line. Also, what does the bore look like in #3?- possibly rings?\n\nSure sounds like the turbo has failed and is allowing oil to enter the exhaust causing the smoke.\n\nIt doesn't take much oil getting past the turbine seals to make a lot of smoke, and if it leaks into the exhaust side there will be little or no evidence in the engine, the heat in the turbo and catalytic converter burns it all. Time for a turbo.\n\nreplace turbo. one time i had one in my shop like that i sent my tech out in it to ck it. he went up on the freeway witch i can see from my desk and it stopped traffic up there in both directions. by the time he got to an exit and turned around and got back here, there was a chp helicopter buzzing our building. he had followed him back. we have changed many saab turbos for this problem its leaking oil on the exhaust side and taking directly to a hot cat. good luck\n\nsounds like a bad turbo, maybe a leak at he head gasket or a broken piston, Did you do a leak down test?\n\nsounds like turbo leaking into exhaust,some exhaust manifolds have a screw in plug between head and turbo, at times when not sure I have removed the plug and no smoke from engine but lots of smoke out the exhaust so changed the turbo...hth jerry"}

There was a campaign on them if they were not replaced before. I'm not sure if any other Saab techs have had the replacement cassettes on the 3.0 go bad, but I've found a number of the replacement cassettes on the 2.3s failing again, and the dealer won't replace them a second time for free.\n\nCan you check crank sensor signal? That is probably causing your no injector pulse condition. P1313 is bank 1 ID module combustion signal code which is faulty module but that won't keep it from starting. Crank sensor is cheap and easy to do. (on front side of block under head.)\n\nReplace crank sensor,if fault still exists you'll have to have access to a tech 2 to swap a trionic ecm to deprogram imobilizer,Matt\n\nAnytime you see a knock sensor or cam position sensor on a saab, you probably have a failing ignition cassette, as the car has niether of those components. Sounds like you need a DI, maybe a crank sensor? What is the cranking RPM on a scan tool? If less than 300 needs crank sensor.......\n\nHEY MAT Monitor rpm signal with scanner. if no signal present or is very slow replace crank sensor. As per the ignition codes, DI(direct ignition) modules are very common and do creat problems. Try that and keep us posted. Good luck Jimmy p\n\nchange the direct ignition casettes - coil packs and you'll be fine . They are interchangable - they go often. Just last month we did one that sounded like it jumped the timing chain. It was direct ignition on bank #1 . Now note that this failure will likely cause the fuse blow - fusebox on the driver side dash , on the side !"}

The swirl vacuum switch on the fender just behind the battery should have manifold vacuum at idle. When RPM is above 3600, vacuum should drop to 0, then back to manifold vacuum at idle.

I believe you have a completely different issue. sincerely Dave Griffith\n\nYour fuel pressure at 45 PSI is good/normal. Check to make sure you have good fuel volume and then look for a possible lean problem caused by something other than fuel pressure. Note: Fuel pressure should be 39 - 48 PSI.\n\ni would start with code first, ohm map wires back to ecm if ok i would replace map sensor.

Usually on the LeSabre it's a front one.I would look deeper into the figures coming from the ABS sensers. Good luck.\n\nHi: Try going for a test drive in order to get the sensors hot. With the vehicle parked monitor the sensors while having an assistant kick and push on each wheel at a time. A faulty sensor will show a speed speed signal with the vehicle stationary. Another suggestion is to monitor the frequency instead of the voltage. If the signal drops intermittently it is possible to observe a change in frequency even though the voltage would appear to be steady and matching those of the other sensors. You could also try to place the vehicle on a hoist disconnect the sensor and connect your volt meter the sensor and turn the wheel by hand and observe at each sensor. A faulty one will drop off when you turn the wheel slower. Sorry but I forget the voltage range here I think its under 2 volts and think its about 250 millivolts and up to around 2 volts depending on the speed. I hope this is of some help.

I know alot of GM products have ABS sensors which are an integral part of the hub assembly.

Also have had a bunch of GM pickups with low speed ABS activation due to rust buildup under the front wheelspeed sensors. Almost never illuminates ABS light.\n\nHave you checked the hub bearing assemblies for play? If you have movement in the bearing, you could get an incorrect reading from the wheel speed sensor.

Part is 65.00 plus labor, cheaper than the tow. Ours had gotten to the point that it wouldn't run anymore.\n\nreplace the distributor\n\nI would suspect the distributor is going bad. The bearings in it fail and can lead to intermittent problems and eventually a no start.\n\nMost issues with these vehicles comes from the distributor. It has a optical sensor and the bearing in the distributor starts to disintegrate and bearing dust blocks the light. The only other thing I can think of is if the IAC is getting sticky. Does it stall at idle or at speed? Good luck, Mark\n\nSounds like the distributor is failing. Also check and make sure the timing belt tension is correct. I believe that a loose timing belt is causing the beat up bearings in the distributor."}

I went through a very similar problem on a 2003 Land Rover Dicovery II last year. The customer had been quoted 6,000.00 dollars to fix it along with a few other things.... 3100.00 of it was for an EBCM unit. I scoped it, scanned it, and finally checked TSB's. Replaced the R/F Hub/wheel speed sensor assembly, and VOILA! It was fixed. Keep in mind that if the wheel speed sensor lives in the bearing grease, the normal wear on the bearings introduces micro particles of metal that screw with the abs wheel sensor signal. I had tried just the sensor on the Discovery, but it kept having the problem intermittently. Replacing the hub assembly cured it once and for all.\n\nJohn, Have you checked connector C405 yet? The RR wheel speed sensor circuit passes through this inline harness connector. This connector is part of the fuel tank harness which plugs into the body connector that is located on the under side of the trunk floor near the fuel tank sensor. Terminal \"3E\" of this connector, is not used but it may not be sealed from the outside of the vehicle. This can result in water entering the connector causing the adjacent terminals to become corroded. Also, the female terminals of the connector may have become spread apart causing an intermittent or poor connection. If you need a detailed schematic of the connector just let me know. - Matt Hartland Service\n\nHi John I would check the wss harness. They usually break within 18 inches or so from the wheel. Also check the resistance of the wss and compare it to the other side. I would not chase the rough road sensor problem until you fix the wss problem. Just warn the customer that the rrs problem could re-occur. I have had mixed results with my Genysis scan tool; but pretty reliable on wss problems. Make sure you check for tsb's. Hope this helps.\n\ncheck for a broken wire in the covering going to the speed sensor that is in question.\n\nWhat was the fix on this one?\n\nHi you can ohm out the wheel speed sensors & make sure they are all about the same. If they are all the same I would check and make sure the wires are good from the speed sensor to the abs module, ohm them from the sensor to the module. Look for breaks in the wire where it may have been rubbing.If all good there you can scope the speed sensor while turning the wheel.\n\nI have had sensors act the same way. The hard part is getting it to act up while you are connected to it. Also had mice chew wires for the speed sensors, they will go out of there way and around other wires just to nibble on abs wires, not sure why, but they do. hope this helps. Tom"}

Any fix has potential to cause other numerous suspicions of less than expected outcome. 2. From experience several options exist. A. Least expensive & helps many is to use 15-40w Shell Rotella oil, have seen it help more than any other type or viscosity of oil. B. Get in deep to try some valve seal or oil ring replacement, however it is usually the excessive bearing clearance of mains & rods throwing excess oil around and over powering rings and burning in cylinders causing this problem, what maintence record does this vehicle have ? Do the math for cyl revs per mile/gear ratio/tire size, it is seven years old, this is 4 1/2 times around the earth at 113k, more wear than most customers would like to admit, what would you stake your cash on ? C. Have owner locate his own used or new engine & have it delivered to be installed, then it is his engine, you did not buy or supply it this way, only be responsible for installing it correctly is a safer way to solve these issues.

Please discard PIP4492J.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Important: This PI does not apply to 2007 model year vehicles equipped with the 5.3L Engine RPO Code LC9 or LH6. Please refer to the latest version of PIP4574 for 2007 model year vehicles equipped with RPO Code LC9 or LH6 Engines that have an oil consumption concern. For all others, refer to the recommendations below.The following diagnosis might be helpful if the vehicle exhibits the symptom(s) described in this PI.Condition/Concern: On rare occasions, some customers may complain of excessive oil consumption and/or blue exhaust smoke. Upon inspection, obvious oil will be found in the intake manifold and/or PCV vacuum tube.This may be the result of:\u2022 A PCV fresh air hose that is pinched or restricted by plastic casting flash (this would normally be a concern since new, or shortly after engine repairs).\u2022 Plugged PCV baffle drain holes in the valve cover that has the PCV vacuum pipe attached to it (this would normally be a concern at high mileage).\u2022 An improperly sealed PCV valve cover baffle (this would normally be a concern since new, or shortly after valve cover replacement).\u2022 Over-aggressive valve lifters (generally occur at low mileage - less than 10,000 miles or so).Recommendation/Instructions: Important: This PI does not apply to 2007 model year vehicles equipped with the 5.3L Engine RPO Code LC9 or LH6. Please refer to the latest version of PIP4574 for 2007 model year vehicles equipped with RPO Code LC9 or LH6 Engines that have an oil consumption concern. If bulletin 01-06-01-011 identifies excessive oil consumption but SI diagnosis does not isolate the cause of it, inspect the PCV vacuum pipe to see if obvious oil drips out of it and look through the throttle body opening to see if there is obvious standing oil in the bottom of the intake manifold (normally a 1/4 quart or more if this PI applies). If there is obvious oil in the PCV vacuum pipe or in the bottom of the intake, perform the steps below and re-evaluate the oil consumption concern:Inspect the fresh air hose/pipe and all related connections to make sure that no restrictions exist (plastic casting flash, pinched hose, etc.), which may cause excessive crankcase vacuum. Repair the restriction as necessary. Generally, the oil consumption would have been a concern since new, or shortly after engine repairs, if this is the root cause. Inspect the PCV baffle drain holes shown below to see if they are plugged with hardened oil deposits. These are located in the valve cover that has the PCV vacuum pipe attached to it. If they are plugged, replace the valve cover, ensure that the customer is changing their oil according to the maintenance schedule in their owner's manual, and re-evaluate the concern. Generally, the oil consumption would not have appeared until several thousand miles accumulated if this is the root cause. Important: If this step leads to valve cover replacement, perform step 3 on the replacement valve cover before installing it. PCV Baffle Drain Holes: Inspect the PCV baffle to ensure that it is properly sealed to the valve cover by flipping it over and adding a little oil to the baffle to valve cover joint as shown below. The oil should stay in place as shown on the 2 outer valve covers below. If the oil drains into the PCV baffle as pointed out on the middle valve cover below, replace the valve cover. Generally, the oil consumption would have been present early in the life of the vehicle or shortly after valve cover replacement if this is the root cause. Important: If this step leads to valve cover replacement, perform this step on the replacement valve cover before installing it. PCV Baffle Comparison If there is no problem found above but there is obvious oil in the PCV vacuum pipe or bottom of the intake manifold, this may be the result of the PCV system ingesting excessive oil due to an over-aggressive lifter. Sometimes this may occur intermittently so inspecting the lifter flow may or may not isolate the suspect lifter. As a result, all 16 lifters should be replaced if steps 1-3 above do not isolate the cause of excessive oil in the intake. Important: If Step 2 or 3 leads to valve cover replacement, perform Step 3 on the replacement valve cover before installing it. Important: Drain/clean the oil out of the intake manifold and install the intake with new intake gaskets before releasing the vehicle to the customer. If this is not performed, the customer may return with an exhaust smoke complaint even though their oil consumption complaint may be repaired. Important: Make sure that the replacement lifters do not have any sign of debris in the plunger area as shown in the bottom-center lifter below. If there is debris present, remove it with some light shop air. Do not stick anything in the plunger area to remove it such as a screwdriver. Example of Debris in LifterPlease follow this diagnostic or repair process thoroughly and complete each step.

Please discard Corporate Bulletin Number 01-06-01-011E (Section 06 -- Engine/Propulsion System).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------All engines require oil to lubricate and protect the load bearing and internal moving parts from wear including cylinder walls, pistons and piston rings. When a piston moves down its cylinder, a thin film of oil is left on the cylinder wall. During the power stroke, part of this oil layer is consumed in the combustion process. As a result, varying rates of oil consumption are accepted as normal in all engines.Oil Consumption The accepted rate of oil consumption for engines used in the vehicles referenced is 0.946 liter (1 qt) in 3200 km (2000 mi).Important: This rate only applies to personal use vehicles, under warranty, that are driven in a non-aggressive manner and maintained in accordance with the appropriate maintenance schedule, with less than 58,000 km (36,000 mi), or driven at legal speeds in an unloaded (for trucks) condition. Important: This rate does not apply to vehicles that are driven in an aggressive manner, at high RPM, high speeds, or in a loaded condition (for trucks). Oil consumption for vehicles driven under these conditions will be more. Many factors can affect a customer's concern with oil consumption. Driving habits and vehicle maintenance vary from owner to owner. Thoroughly evaluate each case before deciding whether the vehicle in question has abnormal engine oil consumption.Gasket and External Leaks Inspect the oil pan and engine covers for leakage due to over-tightened, damaged, or out of place gaskets. Inspect oil lines and fittings for signs of leakage.Improper Reading of the Oil Level Indicator (Dipstick) Verify that the dipstick tube is fully seated in the block. When checking the oil level, make sure the dipstick is wiped clean before taking an oil level reading and fully depress the dipstick until the shoulder bottoms out on the dipstick tube. The dipstick should be the proper part number for the engine/vehicle that is being checked.Notice: Operating your vehicle with an oil level that is below the minimum level indicated on the engine oil dipstick can result in severe engine damage. Repairs resulting from operating an engine with insufficient oil are not covered under the terms of the New Vehicle Warranty. Important: Refer to Owner Manual in SI for checking and adding engine oil. Not Waiting Long Enough After Running Engine to Check Oil Level Some engines require more time than others for the oil to drain back into the crankcase. To assure a sufficient amount of oil has drained back to the crankcase, and an accurate reading can be obtained, the vehicle should be allowed to sit for at least 15 minutes, after the engine has been shut off, before taking an oil level reading. In order to ensure accurate results, the temperature of the oil should be close to the same temperature as the last time the oil level was checked.Important: This does not apply to 2006-2009 Corvette Z06 equipped with the 7.0L LS7 and the 2009 Corvette ZR-1 with the 6.2L LS9 engines (dry sump). Follow the instructions in the Owner Manual for checking the oil in this application. Improper Oil Fill After an Oil Change Following an oil change, verify that the proper amount and type of oil was put in the engine and that the oil level on the dipstick is not above the full mark or below the add marks. Refer to the Owner Manual or Service Manual for information on recommended oil quantity, viscosity, and quality.Aggressive Driving, High Speed or High RPM Driving Aggressive driving and/or continuous driving at high speeds/high RPMs will increase oil consumption. Because this may not always be an everyday occurrence, it is hard to determine exactly how much the oil economy will be affected.A higher rate of oil consumption is normal for vehicles equipped with manual transmissions that are driven aggressively. By \"aggressive,\" we mean operation at high RPM (3,000 RPM to redline), with frequent use of engine braking (using the engine to slow the vehicle). Vehicles that are driven aggressively may consume engine oil at a rate of up to 0.946 L (1 quart) every 805 km (500 mi). This is normal for a vehicle that is driven aggressively. No repair is necessary. This characteristic does, however, require the owner to check the engine oil level at sufficiently frequent intervals, especially when driving aggressively, to assure the oil level remains within the recommended operating range. As the Owner\u2019s Manual recommends, you should check the oil level every time you get fuel. Towing or Heavy Usage Towing a trailer will increase oil consumption and may cause oil consumption to fall below the normal accepted rate referenced in this bulletin for an unloaded vehicle in a personal use application. Large frontal area trailers will further increase the work required from the engine, especially at highway speeds, and thus increases the rate of oil consumption.Crankcase Ventilation System Verify that the positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system is operating properly. Blockages, restrictions, or damage to the PCV system can result in increased oil use.Oil Dilution (Fuel and Water) On vehicles that are usually driven short distances, less than 8 km (5 mi), especially in colder weather, unburned fuel and condensation generated from cold engine operation may not get hot enough to evaporate out of the oil. When this occurs, the dipstick may indicate that the oil level is over-full. Subsequent driving on a trip of sufficient length to enable normal engine operating temperature for 30 minutes or more, in order to vaporize excess moisture and fuel, may give the customer the impression of excessive oil consumption.Engine Temperature If an engine is run at overheated temperatures (see Owner's Manual or Service Manual) for more than brief periods, oil will oxidize at a faster than normal rate. In addition, gaskets may distort, piston rings may stick, and excessive wear may result. Verify that all cooling system components are in proper working order.Engine Wear Piston scuffing, excessive piston-to-wall clearance, tapered or out of round cylinders, worn, damaged or improperly installed valve guides, seals and piston rings will all cause an increase in oil consumption.Measurement of Oil Consumption Engines require a period of time to BREAK IN so that moving parts are properly seated. Therefore, oil economy should not be tested until the vehicle has accumulated at least 6400 km (4000 mi). An exception would be allowed only if an engine is reported to be using more than 0.946 liter (1 qt) in 1600 km (1000 mi).Verify that the engine has no external leaks. Repair as necessary. Verify that the engine is at normal operating temperature (see Owner's Manual or Service Manual). Park the vehicle on a level surface. Wait at least 15 minutes, after the engine is shut off, before checking the oil level to make sure that the oil has had time to drain back into the crankcase. Verify that the oil level is at, but not above, the full mark on the dipstick, and that the proper viscosity and quality oil are being used as recommended in the Owner's Manual. Record the vehicle mileage, date, and exact oil level on the form included in this bulletin. Ask the customer to verify the oil level, each time the vehicle is fueled, following steps 1-6 and return the vehicle to the dealership if the oil level is found at or below the add mark, 0.946 liter (1 qt) low. If the oil level remains above the add mark, the customer should continue to operate the vehicle and verify the engine oil level until 3200 km (2000 mi) has accumulated before returning to the dealership for a final evaluation. If the final evaluation shows that the engine uses more than 0.946 liter (1 qt) in 3200 km (2000 mi), follow the published symptom diagnostics as described in the appropriate Service Manual. If the oil consumption test shows that the engine uses less than 0.946 liter (1 qt) in 3200 km (2000 mi), explain to the customer that their engine meets the guidelines for oil consumption.

When a piston moves down its cylinder, a thin film of oil is left on the cylinder wall. During the combustion process, part of this oil layer is consumed. As a result, varying rates of oil consumption are accepted as normal in all engines.Oil Consumption Oil usage has a direct relationship with the amount of fuel used. The harder an engine works, the more fuel and oil it will use. Therefore, oil usage as a factor of fuel usage is a more accurate indicator of acceptable oil consumption levels than vehicle mileage for vehicles at or above 8600 GVW.The accepted rate of oil consumption for gasoline engines in vehicles at or above 8600 GVW is 0.946 liter (1 qt) within 379 liters (100 gallons) of fuel used. This rate only applies to vehicles under warranty, maintained in accordance with the appropriate maintenance schedule, driven at legal speeds and within design intent of the vehicle.Many factors can affect an owner's concern with oil consumption. Driving habits and vehicle maintenance vary from owner to owner. Thoroughly evaluate each case before deciding whether the vehicle in question has abnormal engine oil consumption.Gasket and External Leaks Inspect the oil pans, engine covers, and the engine oil cooler for leakage. Inspect for oil leakage into the engine coolant. Improper Reading of the Oil Level Indicator (Dipstick) The vehicle must be parked on a level surface to obtain accurate oil level readings. Verify that the dipstick tube is fully seated in the block. When checking the oil level, make sure the dipstick is wiped clean before taking an oil level reading and fully depress the dipstick until the shoulder bottoms out on the dipstick tube. The dipstick should be the proper part number for the engine/vehicle that is being checked.Not Waiting Long Enough After Running Engine to Check Oil Level The vehicle should be allowed to sit for at least 15 minutes, after the engine has been shut off, before taking an oil level reading to assure the oil has had enough time to drain back into the crankcase. In order to ensure accurate results, the temperature of the oil should be close to the same temperature as the last time the oil level was checked.Improper Oil Fill After an Oil Change Following an oil change, verify that the proper amount and type of oil was put in the engine and that the oil level on the dipstick is not above the full mark or below the add marks. Refer to the Owner's Manual or Service Manual for information on recommended oil quantity, viscosity, and quality.High Speed or High RPM Driving Continuous driving at high speeds/high RPMs may increase oil consumption. Because this may not always be an everyday occurrence, it is hard to determine exactly how much the oil economy will be affected.Towing or Heavy Usage Towing a trailer or hauling additional weight will increase oil consumption. Large frontal area trailers will further increase the work required from the engine, especially at highway speeds, and thus increases the rate of oil consumption.PTO Operation Operation of a PTO will increase fuel and oil usage, as the PTO driven accessory uses engine power to operate.Crankcase Ventilation System Verify that the positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system is operating properly. Blockages, restrictions or damage to the PCV system can result in increased oil use.Oil Dilution from Condensation On vehicles that are usually driven short distances, less than 8 km (5 mi), especially in colder weather, condensation generated from cold engine operation may not get hot enough to evaporate out of the oil. When this occurs, the dipstick may indicate that the oil level is over-full. Subsequent driving on a trip of sufficient length to enable normal engine operating temperature for 30 minutes or more, in order to vaporize excess moisture, may give the customer the impression of excessive oil consumption.Engine Temperature If an engine is run at overheated temperatures (see Owner's Manual or Service Manual) for more than brief periods, oil will oxidize at a faster than normal rate. In addition, gaskets may distort, piston rings may stick, and excessive wear may result. Verify that all cooling system components are in proper working order.Engine Wear Piston scuffing, excessive piston-to-wall clearance, tapered or out of round cylinders, worn, damaged or improperly installed valve guides, seals and piston rings will all cause an increase in oil consumption.Measurement of Oil Consumption Engines require a period of time to BREAK IN so that moving parts are properly seated. Therefore, oil economy should not be tested until the vehicle has accumulated at least 8000 km (5000 mi) and the oil has been changed for the first time. During initial engine break-in periods before the first oil change, oil consumption may exceed 1.9 liters (2 quarts) or more per 379 liters (100 gallons) of fuel used.Verify that the engine has no external leaks. Repair as necessary. Begin oil consumption test after next regularly scheduled oil and filter change. Oil changes should not be performed during the test. Verify that the engine is at normal operating temperature (see Owner's Manual or Service Manual). Park the vehicle on a level surface. Wait at least 15 minutes, after the engine is shut off, before checking the oil level to make sure that most of the oil has had time to drain back into the crankcase. Verify that the oil level is at, but not above, the full mark on the dipstick and that the proper viscosity and quality oil are being used as recommended in the Owner's Manual. Dealer should record the vehicle mileage, date and engine hours at the start of the test on the form included in this bulletin. Ask the customer to verify and record the date, odometer, oil level, fuel added, and engine hours, each time the vehicle is fueled, following steps 3-5 and return the vehicle to the dealership if the oil level is found at or below the add mark, 0.946 liter (1 qt) low, if possible. The dealer will add oil to return the oil level to full. If the oil level remains above the add mark, the customer should continue to operate the vehicle and verify the engine oil level until either the oil level drops to or below the add mark or at least 4800 km (3000 mi) has accumulated since the test began before returning to the dealership for a final evaluation. If the final evaluation shows that the engine uses more than 0.946 liter (1 qt) in 379 liters (100 gallons) of fuel used, follow the published symptom diagnostics as described in the appropriate Service Manual. If the oil consumption test shows that the engine uses less than 0.946 liter (1 qt) in 379 liters (100 gallons) of fuel used, explain to the customer that their engine meets the guidelines for oil consumption.

You can test your valve seals by letting your engine idle for fifteen minutes,than rapidly opening the throttle. If the seals leak,oil will be drawn into the intake guides under high vacuum of idle.The rapid throttle opening will cause the oil to enter and burn quickly and exit in a large cloud. It should clear up quickly,and a repeat should prove. Caution,Your cat. convertors wont like it!\n\nI would definetly switch back to regular oil and see how it does before going into it.I've heard of problems with Mobil 1 on low mileage motors before. If the problem started when it was switched definitly switch back first.\n\nA boroscope in the holes would verify if it was rings by the clean wash around the outside of the pistons. We have however seen some head problems at our shop as far as premature guide wear. Good luck\n\nI use synthetic oil religiously, because I have seen how much better high mileage motors look on tear down after running synthetic. However, every motor I have used synthetic in has used more oil after switching. Usually about a quart per thousand miles. That aside, if you see smoke on startup after sitting with the engine off for some time, it's valve guides/seals. If you see smoke out the tail pipe under hard acceleration, it's the rings. With as many mile as is on the motor, it could be both.\n\nScott, do yourself a favor and verify this oil consumption yourself, dont take customers word. You might just end up chasing clouds because these engines dont have many oil consumption concerns."}

(CEL not on) Has anyone out there replaced these commonly for a no start on the land rovers.Also I am getting code C1a20 after a short drive (suspension resovoir pressure slow to fill) I checked for leaks found none but there is a bulletin for the compressor exhaust sticking open. Just wondering if there is any common leaks in the suspension system before I replace the compresssor.

I have yet to have a no start due to spark, but they are prone to fuel flooding.\n\nTristan. I've seen the fuel pump relays cause the crank no start. As for the suspension the other two posts pretty much sum up my experiences.\n\ni have replaced crank sensor on them for no start hth jimmy\n\nHey Tristan,seen a few issues with codes logged,especially lean codes and misfire codes,usually on cold start....two main issues i've seen is contaminated fuel from ethanol,what happens is the ethanol doesnt have the thermal efficiency of gasoline and the engine computer thinks its running lean,you can take a fuel sample and mix it with equal parts water in a small container,give it a shake and let it sit 10-20 mins,you should then see the gasoline on top,water on bottom and ethanol in middle,anything more than 10% ethanol will cause a problem...the other causes i've seen is software in engine control module,lots of issues when this vehicle first came out,intermittant low power,vehicles were running to lean,the update fixed more than 10 vehicles,all lr3's....hope this helps,goodluck\n\nThe light is not supposed to stay on if the fault(s) clear. But it should have been on when the fault(s) flagged. Maybe customer failed to say or didn't notice.So, those faults did happen - and remember most have to occur twice before being flagged.No power may well just be it went into reduced power due to the faults. Hardly surprising.What you're seeing is fairly typical for a car with faults. Now you just have to fix 'em LOL\n\nThere is a Land Rover service bulliton suggesting to inspect the condition of the fuse box next to the battery. pay close attention to the fuel pump fuse. Typicaly one of the terminals for the fuse are melted.... keep in mind that this doesn't happen by accident, i typical replace the fuel pump as well as making the electrical repairs. part 2: electrical repair, If you call land rover, the only way to get this fuse box is with the entire engine harness (not fun to put in). This is what i do to repair it, lift the fuse box and cut out both legs of the fuel pump fuse from the fuse box, call your local parts store and get an inline fuse kit (using the traditional plastic fuse, not the minifuse as the terimals are bigger) and then replace the fuel pump.\n\nNo vacuum leaks hot or cold? You may want to check both ways... These are fairly common for air flow meters, I also learned the hard way once that a loose air box lid will set fuel trim codes. Also, never use an oiled-media filter like a k&n, they kill air flow meters. Lastly, it may be time to check your fuel pressure. Good luck."}

This Tundra originally came in for NH state inspection. It failed the emissions test for no communication. Customer brought it to another shop close to his work, they were not able to find anything and suggested he have the ecm flashed by the dealer. Now it's back at my shop, and I told him that the dealer could not reflash it if they couldn't communicate with it. I have tried my MODIS, LAUNCH X431 and Genisys, all would not comm. with the ECM, BCM or TCM. Strange thing is that they will comm. with the Airbag and ABS modules within the first few minutes the key is on, and then not a little later. Cycle the key, and you can read them again. I have ohmed out the K-line and L-lines back to the ecm, disconnected all modules one by one and checked comm. I also cut the K-line and L-lines at the ecm and jumped them directly to the scan tool(with GND at pins 4&5, and power to pin 16. Still no communication. Also, the CEL works KOEO, and is not on with vehicle running. There are no drivability issues, all fuses are good, and I removed all the pins on the OBDII connector and tighten the connections. I know there are probably a few other things I tried, but I left the work order with my notes at home, and wanted to post this right away. The customer is really cheap, and wants to spend as little $$ as possible, and is pressuring me to limit the amount of time looking at it, but wants it fixed by Monday. I don't want to jump and put an ecm in it if I don't have too, I'm hoping that I didn't miss something in my diagnosis - hence the post here. Sorry for the long post, but I am trying to give all the pertinent info. Thanks again in advance for your help.", "output": "try this, older audi cars had ABS computers that would interrupt the ECU communication, simply disconnect the big harness at the ABS module then cycle the key and try again to read the ECU, good luck.\n\nwiring diagram shows that this vehicle does not have a multiplex comunication bus line from the ECM to any other components except the DLC. The SKID control ECU is hard wired direct to the ECM (old school). That being said I'd check all the powers and ground to the ECM & once I was absolutely positive that those things were bullet proof. I'd disconnect the E3 connector from the ECM and after ensuring that the SIL & TC circuits on pins 18 & 20 were not shorted to voltage, shorted to each other & or ground, I'd perform a voltage drop across the TC circuit from pin 20 of the ECM to pin 13 of the DLC. I would send 12v through that circuit using a load on the other end & then measure the voltage drop across that wire while its under a load. I would then perfrom the same loaded voltage drop test across the SIL circuit from pin 18 of the E3 connector to pin 7 of the DLC. If your voltage drop is 0.1v or less than your wiring is fine. I'd be carefull that pin fit isn't the cause as well. If pin fit is good, voltage drop is good & ECM has all its power and ground, then I'd feel perfectly comfortable calling it an ECM. The evidence would have spoken for itself. Let me know.\n\nECM communicates with scan tool on k-line pin 7 only. This wire should be 12 volts steady until the scan tool establishes communication then pulse. Check for 12 volts. If not, check 7.5a obd fuse in driver kick panel for power.\n\ncheck under the dash and look for evidence of water intrusion @ junction block connections. ie. rust marks and or dried rusty drips from a poor glass installation or from an inferior body repair.\n\nSounds like it ain't just the truck that has a problem. This's one of those guys you need to send down the road. He can't have it both ways. He either needs to let you find the problem and fix it or quit griping. I know I didn't give any help as far as fixin the truck goes, but I've given you what I believe to be the best course of action given this situation.\n\ndid you check grounds to the pcm?\n\nI agree with Dustin get rid of the customer as he will just cost you money & lose you good customers. We check for lost com by disconnecting other computers one at a time till com comes back then reconnect till we lose it. Get rid of the bad & focus on the good customers, you will sleep better & make more money. good luck\n\nSteve, sounds like ecm,if the wiring is good, the only component left is ecm. good luck\n\nIt does sound like an ECM issue, but you definitely need to check wiring first. As stated before, pin 7 of the OBD connector should have 12V with KOEO. Once you initiate communication with the scan tool, the scan tool will ground that line and pull it down to near 0V. At that point, the ECU will ground and release the line making a 12V square wave signal that the scan tool can decode into useful data. Use an OBD breakout box to scope that line while trying to communicate with the ECU. If you don't have a breakout box then try backprobing the OBD connector at pin 7 while trying to communicate. If the 12V isn't there on that line, start checking fuses and wiring. That being said, tightwads and communication/computer issues are like water and electricity, they don't mix. Make this truck owner understand that if he wants it fixed, ESPECIALLY if he wants it by Monday, he is gonna have to let you do what you do. The burden of cost is on him, not you. Remember, you didn't engineer, build, sell, buy, own, or break this truck. You are simply trying to fix it. It's his problem, and if he doesn't want to pay what the problem is worth, he can take it elsewhere. Just my two cents worth...\n\nOne of the hardest things I had to learn when I left the Nissan dealer and started my own shop 16 yrs ago is that you don't have to fix every car on the road . I suggest you simply tell the cust. that this ones got you stumped and send him down the road. Your not going to make any money and could cost you good cust. This is a profession not a hoby"}

This vehicle, according to the customer, experienced smells and smoke coming from the left rear wheel after being driven about 5 miles.It was towed in and sat overnight in our parking lot.We drove it and could not simulate the symptom.The tempature of the rotors was within 50-70 degrees of each other side to side front and rear.The warmer side was actually the right rear. The ceramic brake pads were removed and inspected and had no smell or glazing that would be expected if they got hot,the rotors looked the same from side to side, they seemed a little discolored but no blueish color like we usually see in the situations.The calipers pushed in easily with the bleeder open and the sliders were free.We removed the rotors and inspected the parking brake shoes, they did not look like they had any damage or had been driven with the parking brake on.The customer states she never uses the parking brake,(AT) and saw no warning lights during this incident. After interrigating the customer for any possible clues she stated that, after sitting for three days during the holiday,(3-4 days ago)the battery was dead and only clicked when the key was turned.The car did not jump off and the battery was charged with a home style charger.The battery and charging system were checked by AZ and checked out OK.I rechecked and confirmed no problems or parasitic draw issues.The ABS was checked for codes and the following history codes were found,61-Battery voltage low,83 ECM relation failure,112 internal power source failure,(stuck off?)I assumed the codes were low voltage related, and the diagnostic tree stated to clear and see if they return.The codes were cleared, the vehicle was again driven for over 1hour,stop and go and had no symptoms or code returns. Of course the customer is having a hard time understanding why her newly done brake job is failing and a lot of carefull educating and explaining is being utilized but she is terrified of the car and we have run out of ideas.Thanks in advance.", "output": "I do not use any thing but Honda parts on Honda cars (acura also) Now if I had to fix this car I would put a Honda remand caliper on the side you are having a problem with. also Honda pads.

Sounds like greasy pawprints burning off, or the binders in the new pads outgassing as they reach operating temp for the first time.\n\nDid customer smell this right after repair or nothing until 2500 miles later. If right after may have been some grease & fluid on pads burning off. Some times anti rattle clips hold pads too tight. Might be related to ABS codes you found. Joe\n\nHas the customer let anyone else drive the vehicle that could have set the park brake? Was the correct brake fluid used during the flush, not sure what is recommended for fluid. Pull the caliper off and recheck for rust under the slides. As for the draw, how long did you let it set with your meter connected? Did all electrical have time to shut down?\n\nI have been in this situation myself. The fear from the customer is what you are trying to fix right now because you can't find a problem with the car. Have the customer take you for a drive in her car. She said it was after a 5 mile drive. Have her drive 7 to 10 miles with you along. Once you stop, both of you should get out and go to each wheel and smell. Take your thermometer and show her the temps. While she drives you keep her engaged in conversation but watch what she does with the brake pedal. She may be left foot braking and never taking her foot all the way off of the pedal. Keeping her in conversation will most likely let you see the real way she drives. Some people drive more careful if they think the real way they drive might be criticized. By the way, have the customer drive in the same conditions they drove on the day the problem happened. Freeway or in town or both.\n\nMichael..if Im following you correctly, you did the brake job about 2500 miles ago but the customer is still scared to drive the car?..or you did the job 2500 miles ago and she recently drove it about 5 miles, got the smoke and smell and had it towed in?..if its the first, it was probably that oily residue they place on some rotors that wasnt completely cleaned off and heated up and smoked (after a brake job here, I usually drive the car/truck about 200 feet lightly riding the brake to A seat the pads/shoes to the rotor/drum and B to burn off any residue)..if it was the later, she ma have got something splashed up onto that wheel assembly that burnt off and smelled when it hit the hot rotor..follow what Jim suggested and give her some peace of mind that it probably was a 1 off incident (or she is a left foot braker and doesnt even realize it)\n\nSince you can't duplicate it, have her take you for a 10 mile drive and see if the symptom re-occurs. It is possible that she picked up something on the road which caused the smell and the smoke and the discoloration.\n\nHey Michael; Are you sure that both of your rear brake cables are free. I have seen a fair number of Accord cables rusted/binding. Shalom Michael\n\nYour inspection seems incredibly thorough, you can't duplicate the problem, and it is questionable whether there actually was one to begin with.Go home, get some sleep. Suggest she do the same. Tell her you'll keep a close eye on the rear brakes when you do her regular maintenance services, but if it continues to drive properly, then there's not much point in trying to fix what ain't broke.If there was a problem with installation or parts, it would not have taken 2500 miles to show up, and then only once.\n\nCould have been something on the pads are roter burning off. Bill\n\nas far as the draw, the HFL unit which is hands free link (bluetooth) intermittently stays powered up in these TLs' If she doesn't use it, disconnect it. It is in the roof console. If she uses it, replace the unit. If it is an HFL unit problem and she uses it, she will probably have had recent problems with it nit working correctly.\n\nHello,Have see sticking ABS unit on older units not serviced. Old fluid in system.HTH,Gino\n\nI would replace both rear calipers and bleed the system\n\nHave you check the brake fluid recently to make sure is to the max line if lower the red brake light will come on and the vsa/abs yellow triangle will automatically come on due to low brake fluid make sure to add fluid to max line and use only dot3 genuine acura brake fluid.. have you tried scaning the abs control module when does lights come on?. I had issues with aftermarket rotors and pads on this.. I would only use genuine pads and rotors. Some aftermarket china rotors are not precisely made accurate that can't tell by eye\n\nI would re scan abs control. Unit see if any dtc came back\n\nDoes she go through pads faster than normal? She might be a two footed driver. They think that's the way they're supposed to drive. We've all seen the brake lights come \"ON\" when the driver in front of you puts their foot on the brake pedal going UP hill as they get close to the top of the hill or come to a curve in the hill. Imagine how fast they go through brake pads? I don't know how you get rid of fear in a driver for a condition that does NOT exit. I'd use Holy Water or send her to another shop and let her bother them. Sometimes you have to fire a customer."}

A lot of the Siennas of teh same vintage had a bad amp that would power itself up. Here's a workaround. Install a relay so Fuse #3 only supplies power when ignition is on. A lot cheaper than a replacement amp. Personally I wouldn't trust checking ohms to ground with the fuze pulled. I'd put my ammeter inline and supply the circuit with 12V and measure milliamps instead. If you have a min/max meter you may be able to catch it in the act.\n\nUp to 55ma is considered normal and wont kill the battery overnite, you must have something else turning on intermittantly. The JL Audio amp is a common source of parasitic draw but it looks like you have already eliminated that. Does the truck have anything aftermarket on it? Most electrical issues i see are a result of A/M remotes starts, trailer brake controllers, etc."}

People even techs sometimes think there can only be one problem with a car when you could have several both related and unrelated. its not always an electronic or pcm update either. as long as the fan eventually goes off after turning off the car i would not be overly concerned as long as your temps are in a reasonable range. thermostats can be an issue. maybe its programmed to cut back off at 184 and is never able to get there due to a mechanical fault. have you checked the temperature with an external thermometer and compared it to scanner readings? the misfire could be a number of things coil(s) injectors egr if it has that. bad gas...to name a few\n\nor a blown head gasket in the early throes of failure have you checked for carbon monoxide in radiator\n\nAllen: chase the misfire issue not the fan. This is a normal strategy on some GM vehicles. Have seen it many times over the years, and it IS a Saturn after all! LOL! What are trims? They have tons of issues with valves sticking and bulletins on the injectors...\n\nAllen,I would take a close look at the ignition primary waveform on this vehicle with a lab scope. Use peak detection your scope and look closely for negative spikes being caused by ignition secondary leaking into the primary. I have seen this issue on quite a few vehicles and the problem was the transistor for the ignition coil going into shock from being hit with too much negative voltage. Removing the voltage by turning the key off allows the transistor to recover and start functioning normally.

It was my understanding however, that the PCM shuts off fuel for the first three start attempts, and then disables the starter. On this car, security lives in the instrument cluster. The cluster monitors the lock switch, door handle switch, and ign. switch to see if they close in the right order. If any of these switches, or the cluster is bad, you will have a no-start condition. Use a scan tool to determine if the PCM is shutting down the car because of the security system. If so, check to see that the cluster sees the switches opening and closing. If not, change the offending switch. You can get a remanufactured cluster directly from Hunt Automotive Electronics, 1-800-624-2726.\n\nfirst thing i would try is to test the energizer wire to make sure its connected.

These codes may be current, but are usually stored as history codes.Recommendation/Instructions: Two areas of wire chaffing or rub through have been reported and verified. Both are near the left front corner of the engine compartment.If the wheel speed sensor wires are tight where they pass under the front of the transmission side cover, chaffing can occur as the powertrain moves on its mounts. This can be seen best from under the vehicle or from within the left front wheel well. At the air conditioner dryer canister the ABS harness splits. If this split is tight against the dryer canister bracket, the unprotected wires can chafe as the powertrain moves on its mounts. This can be easily seen from the top of the engine compartment, left front. Correction: Repair any damaged wires and reroute in such a way as to prevent any further chaffing.I have also seen the wiring going to the wss brake and intermittently cause irratic signals, you can test the wiring by racking the vehicle, putting it in drive, letting the wheels spin up a bit and carfully crab the wiring and move it around to get it to act up. Good luck.\n\nHey kyle terry here i have worked as a gm tech for a few years and have seen smilar problems,have you tried a new wheel speed sensor or checked to see if the tone ring,or reluctor wheel as some people call it has a crack also make sure that the air gap between the sensor and the hub is not to large causing an intermitant drop out of signal.Hope that this helps you\n\nhi kyle, How is the connector?, had to change couples of them\n\ntake a closer look at the harness from sensor to the abs controller,may have to open up harness.\n\nCheck the wiring harness along the lower control arm. The flexing of the harness from the movement of the lower control arm can cause an intermittent open in the wire. Sometimes just the turning of the steering wheel from left to right (forceing the control arms up & down) will cause the fault.\n\nThese vehicles are noted for the wiring harness either to rub thru on the A/C accumulator or trans. If you have an intermittant drop-out, I would hook my meter or scope to the pigtail disconnected and you should read 4.8 to 5.0 volts and then wiggle the harness and see if you can induce the symptom.You could also switch the left front and the right front terminals at the EBCM and see if the results are the same. If it turns out to be the other wheel you know you have a bad harness which you can also purchase at the dealer. You can get a crimp on pigtail...also very common with these vehicles.Good luck.\n\nKyle, Before you replace the module... put the car up on a hoist and run the vehicle in gear, disconnect the plug from the module that contains the wheel speed sensor input wires and measure the rf and lf signals simultaniously. I like to use my vantage meter, you may have a scope, but at least measure the ac volts off both sensors at the same time. I've had bad signal generators new twice in a row, then bought a GM and problem solved! It is normal for the snap-on scanners to report odd wheel speed values as the speed of the vehicle increases - as long as the values are the same for all wheel speed sensors the system seems to work fine, just don't put too much concern if they all report evenly to 25mph, then all drop back to 9mph while your vehicle is still accellerating (seems to be a snap-on issue & not a vehicle fault).\n\nWe see alot of issue with the wiring harness. usually can get it to act up on hoist while wiggling harness. good luck\n\nkyle, i had one do me quite similar to this, and it was inside the plug-in for the hub assembly. all test well under load, but somehow intermittently flaked out. strange how it works if you clear the codes though. makes it sound like the module. i believe you are on the right track. one thing i would check though: check for a/c voltage leak at alternator or for bad plug wires interupting signal. good luck to you kyle.....kerry\n\ntry this gm bulletin and see if it applies.03-05-25-008.this bulletin has you check the actual harnesses.if the abs module ends up being the problem try modulemaster.com i've used them before and they are alot cheaper.their warranty is 5 years on abs modules so they stand behind their work.\n\nthis may sound stupid but switch the front hub bearings from side to side and see if the problem moves to the other side if it does then you have a bad new bearing\n\nKyle, are you testing the signal right at the computer? I would be more inclined to think the wiring is at fault, maybe near there fender where the harness flexes. Good luck, Artie\n\nKyle, If the signal drops out, then you should isolate the sensor and restest. Disconnect the sensor and scope it. Measuring the ohms will only tell you if it is ecectrically open. Generally not very effective for this situation.

This can be seen best from under the vehicle or from within the left front wheel well. 2. At the air conditioner dryer canister the ABS harness splits. If this split is tight against the dryer canister bracket, the unprotected wires can chafe as the powertrain moves on its mounts. This can be easily seen from the top of the engine compartment, left front.Correction: Repair any damaged wires and reroute in such a way as to prevent any further chaffing."}

Terminal 103 (L/B) should have nearly 0v (grounded) at idle, and battery/system voltage with the engine revving over 2,000rpm. On the bench, at rest, the solenoid should block air between ports A and B (the ones right next to each other) and allow air between A and C. With power and ground provided to the two electrical pins air should pass between A and B, and should be blocked between A and C. Judging by my service information this is purely an electrical circuit code. Good luck.\n\nJim The most common cause of EGR codes for this motor is clogged passages.

Use a scope to look at the data on the PCI bus, there is a main connector at the base of the steering column that acts as the splice for the bus. You can disconnect each module from there and with the scope see if there is any output. It may be a problem with the ECM, check the PCI bus at the ECM connector, if you see data with the scope, cut the wire and look for data out of the ECM. If you get no data or a single timed pulse the ECM is down, you can still get data as that could be on the SCI to the ALDL.\n\nThis I found on Identifix. There are others as well. Tests/Procedures: 3581711. Check to see if the instrument cluster will perform the self test. Begin with the ignition switch in the Lock position. Hold down the trip reset button until the word \"Sof\" and a number appear in the odometer window. If the cluster will not self test, then it is a possible cluster failure. 2. Using a compatible scan tool, try to communicate with all the modules on the vehicle to see which ones are working and which ones are not. 3. If unable to communicate with any modules, start unplugging one at a time until the communication comes back. The module that is disconnected last is taking down the bus circuit. Replace that module.\n\nUnplug the FCM (Front Control Module) and also check the harness in that area for damage from battery corrosion (very common problem).\n\nMight have a bus problem here. Does the vehicle have theft? PCM will communicate over generic com lines even if the pci bus lines are down. The other computers don't have this feature. I know it's a pain but without a pin out box the best thing to do I'd unplug each module on the bus one at a time and check for return of communication. Start with the havc head if its auto temp it probably has bus but I ding think the manual one does.

Sometimes intake leaks don't show up while \"smoke testing.\" You might try spraying brake clean or aome carb cleaner around the intake. There are also problems with the pcv system and the oil fill cap. Injectors should be replaced in full sets! There was a reason two needed replacing and the other two are probably borderline, which makes for an unhappy engine. Check lindertech.com for guaranteed rebuilt and flow tested injectors.\n\nHi JAMES Have you done a leak test on that 3rd cylinder to rule out a valve issue out? They are really common for air mass issues but dont log that as a missfire, you need to find that before going any further"}

THanks", "output": "Valve height is adjusted by shims on this engine. No special tool required other that a feeler gauge. The rockers usually dump due to oil issues. The oil tube above the camshafts clog causing the cam lobes to wear. If cams are replaced, the lifter buckets will need to be re-shimmed. Infiniti TSB #ITB95-064 has the part numbers for all the different thickness shims.\n\nThe cam oiling bar that came on these engines was superceded by one with larger holes to increase oil flow. The only way to \"spit\" a shim or rocker is too much friction between the cam and a follower.\n\nThere is a special tool that very few people have or use. Probably just the Nissan HiPo engine rebuilders. It plugs in the lifter bore and with a dial indicator measures the difference in height of the two valves with shims installed, relative to the lifter bore. One shim is permanent (comes in one thickness only), the other comes in different thicknesses. It's purpose is to get the two valves, with shims, EXACTLY the same height, in order to keep that wide rocker pad in contact with the cam lobe perfectly. Otherwise the lobe/cam will wear prematurely. There is no other way to do it correctly, and make all the parts last. So much for that. I'll go with the others who say it's an oiling issue. Might wantto check the rest of the moving parts on the top of the head.\n\nThis is a common issue with sr20de and det engines when they get revved high. There are a few companies that sell stoppers.

IT IS NOT A CLUTCH ISSUE, as 5th gear reengages normally every time, and when the gears are locked out, we can come to a complete stop in 5th and the clutch is completely disengaged with the pedal down. It feels like a interlock issue between the gear shift rails. Visually, all shifter linkage appears normal. All gears work normally except when engaging 5th gear and then downshifting. The customer did state at times they also cannot engage reverse, but we did not experience that issue. Could not find any service bulletins or IATN cases related to these symptoms, so I thought we would send out a case and see if there might be a common problem and fix. Thanks for the help in advance. God Bless.", "output": "A sticking shift rod interlock plunger would explain this situation. When coming out of 5th, the interlock should move back to its neutral position and allow other shift rods to move, allowing another gear to be selected. Perhaps pushing the clutch a second time, changing the dynamics of the main and counter shafts or simply giving the case the resulting \"nudge\" is enough to get that interlock plunger back into its rest position. Unfortunately, there is no way to access the plunger without trans disassembly. Good luck.\n\nI wonder if it's possible to remove the shifter linkage off the shift shaft and try to shift it with a screwdriver or vise grips,get a feel for it static, then have an assistant in the car koer, and applying the clutch pedal for you to try to duplicate problem. If you can eliminate linkage, then it's safe to say it needs a m/t tear down and inspection. May have shift fork to 5th with excessive play. Ask if customer habitually rests his/her hand on the shift knob as this will wear the shift fork. The previous responder probably has a better idea of the problem than me , but just my 2 cents.\n\nSeems like a shift linkage issue or internal transmission problem. Use a video scope to inspect the inside of the transmission through the fill plug.\n\nI would strongly , suspect ... the input shaft is sticking to the crank. Pilot bushing seized. Especially since there is a problem going into reverse. If all the gears shift fine at a stop (0mph), try a roadtest, shift to 5th.... pull into the shoulder, while still holding clutch pedal down, shutoff engine. See if it shifts.\n\nThis sounds more like an internal gear component failure. Make sure you inspect the interlock balls and socket if they are up to spec,synchronizer and any shifting mechanism related to the fifth gear.\n\nThat sounds to me like the blocker ring is sticking to the gear. Letting up on the clutch pedal allows the engine torque to break the ring free. The only thing I think you could try is replacing the fluid. Other than that, the transmission would need repair or replacement.\n\nThe Subaru 5 speed, is quite problem free, until you beat it. One person said disconnect the shift link, and try shifting it by hand. This isn't the worst thing I have ever heard. The shift rod on the transmission should be really notchy, when the shifter is disconnected. All the gates should be equally notchy. Once it is in a gear try moving the shift shaft side to side(twisting action), there should be just a little bit of movement, and it will be equal to the other two. There is a service bulletin on the older cars about the nut coming loose, on the main (input) shaft. At which point you will have problems with 5th and reverse. It is not quite the same as you describe though... The most common failure I see, is the bearing at the back of the main shaft fails, and causes the shaft to get sloppy. At that point the shift linkages can have all kinds of problems. The shift shaft you see on the outside has a flat finger that engages one of three forks. If there is any shift forks with worn off nylon \"shoes\", it can make it so the fork doesn't return all the way. In this scenario, the shift interlock is actually working properly, as it is still partially stuck in 5th, and should not allow you to go in any other gear. As far as the occasional \"can't\" get it into reverse; don't try to fix this, it is normal. let the clutch out, and push it back in, then it will go into reverse every time! In the end, it sounds like the transmission will need to come apart for inspection. I have repaired dozens of these. If you pay attention to detail, the problem usually presents itself right away, after you open it up. Also, generally speaking parts are expensive, so just get a used transmission :-)\n\nthe symptom could be related to the reverse check sleeve if it affected the 5th and reverse oper. and for the gears being locked out i would agree with your thought of interlock issue also . is there any metal shaving in the trans. which may cause the intermittent binding of the interlock components and the reverse check sleeve ?"}

Sadly, still a no crank condition as i had previously :( I should also mention that i had No communication with the TCM...Ever. After thoroughly checking all powers/grounds and both communication lines to the TCM...all was good/correct. Obviously, i condemned the TCM...altho it seemed odd that it would start/run/drive when starter was jumped. Long story short, i randomly happen to check the CASE Ground of the TCM(as it rests in a plastic housing)...and i had 8-10 VDC on it....wtf. The blk/white ground wire feeding TCM showed .02vdc. Anyways, a temporary jumper wire from engine grnd to TCM case gave me communication AND started the car now. Apparently, this had a bad Internal ground. I tapped 1 of the top holes to M8x1.25 and ran a lead to the blk/wht wire and soldered it in.....saving a cost of a new TCM and programming.HTH many others!"}

Well when it was all said and done, his car would crank, but no start. This was a 93 Lexus by the way. All signals from dist. to pcm good, No spark, No injecter pulse. No engine light came on with key on. Sounds like same senerio as yours. Make a long story short, He took apart the MAF meter for some reason, and put it back together again, and I didnt find this out till after a couple hours of testing and i came to the PCM conclusion. Well I unplugged the MAF and the car fired right up. Engine light came on and everything. This sounds wierd, i know, But try it and it may be an easy fix. I guess the MAF was shorted out internally, and the PCM has to have a signal from the maf upon startup to run injectors or spark. If you unplug it, it will run in open loop mode. Let me know how it goes....Marv\n\nI had a 93 camary with a similar problem it turned out to be a ground problem.. i took a pair of jumper cables from engine to chassi and it fix the problem.. i don't know if that might help u.. But i very well be the ecu to it might have gotting spiked..\n\nHans, Did the customer remove the battery to charge it and put it back in backwards? I had a 97 camry in here that did all the same things yours does. No guages, radio and clock worked but no spark,no injector pulse and a fuse blown. (sorry but I don't remember which one) The customer had let the car sit so long that the battery went dead. He pulled it and charged it but when he put it back in, he swithced the leads and blew the main 200 amp fuse without knowing it. Once we switched the battery cables back around and replaced the main fuse it fired right up and is still running today. Hope this helps and tell the boss it's not your fault the car broke, he needs to chill out, it's the Holidays.\n\nThese vehicles tend to have coils that short in on themselves.

The wheel cylinder seals would'nt let fluid out, but, on retracting would suck air in. It may not be in the wheel cylinders, as the aged ABS stuff adds a whole new set of problems, but it may be worth looking at.\n\nHi Rick. Try looking at each bleeder when you bleed the system. I have seen cylinders and calipers that don't leek fluid, but will suck air. If you see air right away at a cylinder or caliper, you have found the culprit. Good luck. Brad\n\nI have this problem before, I had to replace the rear drums which where out of specs and had serious cracks in them, also check the calipers and brake hoses for damage or leakage.\n\n1st i would make sure there are no lks in the system. 2nd with a scan tool run a fuctional test of all the solonoids once the pedal is normal again. do this a few times. if the abs system has errors it might show up immeadiatly for you. 3rd, can it be that the abs is false activating causing the pedal to drop, it is possable that (while moving) the abs is kicking in. this is usaully caused by a bad wheel speed sensor. good luck mh\n\nDid you flush and bleed the ABS seperate from the rest of the system or at the same time. Also check the flexible brake lines going to the front wheels. There may be a break down inside the flex linings. !!!!!GLORIFY GOD!!!!!\n\nI have had systems suck air into but not leak out of. Try removing the master cyl lid and blowing air on all lines hoses,and componets except rear wheel cylinders.I found a faulty residual preasure valve that way once.Have a buddy watch for bubbles while you blow air around.\n\nhey rick, i had one run me around once and it was crummy flares on the lines at master. they would not leak but would let air in system, also make sure there are no unions or compressions where you might not see them,especially in the right rear quarter panel/frame area. hth\n\ni hate to say this but check all the lines. If you re bleed the system and it is fine and you have replaced everything else then look at the lines or connections. It is possible for air to get in and not fluid\n\nAre you leaking? I know this sounds insulting but been there done that.Is the fluid level staying constant? Did you use a scan tool to operate rabs during bleed? I have found this helps remove air stuck in rabs selenoids. Is there fluid in the booster? With new master only thing that can cause fade is fluid loss or trapped air.\n\nIf you don't use a scantool to trigger the dump valves in the ABS while bleeding you'll never get a decent pedal. Kenny\n\nOn pedal release, air can be sucked in past the seals. Usually it's wheel cylinders (which you've replaced), but I have also seen it in calipers. Where are you getting the air during the bleeding process. First shot out of a particular wheel, or is it coming from further up the line? Food for thought: Is it possible the auto-adjusters are swapped to the wrong sides? I realize bleeding alone wouldn't have temporarily solved this, but perhaps the brakes were also adjusted up during these visits?\n\ntry to narrow your search....... first try to hold pressure at master (eliminate system) than go to front then rear(line lock rest of system) go from there.. not trying insult, just go to basics....I've had similiar problem had to change master 5 times before problem was solve.(DIFFERENT PART SUPPLIERS) I thhought i was doing something wrong. are they reman. One last thing dont forget that pesky line l/r by lift point ....... Hopes this give some help\n\nare you doing the bleed proceedure after repair. if there is air in the abs hydrolic unit the pedal will be fine until the abs is active. then the air in the abs is in the system.\n\nIt is very possible here to have something in the system either admitting either air or humidity. Even an iffy rubber line, or leaking seal on a caliper or brake cylinder could be the culprit. I think the lead here was the bleed and flush fixing it at one point. As components age, seals ooze slowly, leading to hair pulling. I know. I am bald. Heat cycling can exacerbate this situation. You might consider replacing anything having a rubber or soft seal, including the gasket under the master cylinder cap. Let us know... Ray\n\nokay definitly sounds like a hydraulic problem , if problem comes back try clamping off each brake line too see if pedal gets hard if so then relaes one at a time to isolate problem, also is there a lot of rust may be sucking air thru fittings if lots of rust, anyway good luck\n\nI too have had fits with NEW wheel cylinders and find the bore to be too large for the pressure cup. They work from 3 days to 6000 mi & come back in with a low pedal complaint. When it comes in crack the RR first and look for air then the LR. It's there."}

Output from the control valve is plumbed to the EGR valve with the EGR control solenid tapped into the middle. The solenid's job is to dump the vacuum when no EGR is desired and shut flow off when EGR is enabled. The dump port is the one that you're finding no vacuum on that sits outside the vacuum area at the TB.Testing the check valve involves removing the white-striped hose at the check valve and connecting a vacuum gauge to the check valve at the vacated port. It's supposed to have between 6.3 and 7.1\" Hg at this location with the engine running, but this value isn't adjusted for altitude or engine condition.The green-striped hose is shown to be your vacuum source, which should be straight to manifold vacuum. Check to see that it has good signal and decent flow rate (doesn't seem restricted). If the EGR valve itself can be opened manually with a vacuum pump and it causes the engine to roughen or stall, chances are good that you have a bad vacuum control valve or the EGR solenoid is stuck in the open position at all times. Block its discharge hose at the throttle body to see if it changes anything.\n\nIf no vacuum lines are switched or misrouted then you gotta take the throttle body off to see how the porting is done internally. I remember the old carbs with their myriad of vacuum hoses could do that but I haven't seen a throttle body yet with vacuum issues."}

Basically it was performing fine until about a month ago when he said the transmission started slipping. He took it to the local Volvo dealer, and they wanted to sell him a new trans. Then he called me, (friend of a friend). Anyway, I did some research on the net, and have found that this is the Aisin Warner aw55-50n trans. I drove it and its slips/slides on the 1-2 and the 2-3 shifts. The 3-4 shift isn't bad at all. Between taking it to the dealer and bringing to me the customer had another swedish shop (after the dealer, but before me) flush and change the fluid with the appropriate fluid. (mobil 3309 was used.) Anyway, he's prepared for me to install a reman transmission. My questions are:1: should I have Volvo verify and update the software before or after replacing the trans? and what about the adaptives relearn procedure? does the relearn require the volvo scantool? (it would be great if the software fixed my problem, but after driving it feels like we're beyond that)2: where can I get a reman? I use jasper regularly, but they don't offer this unit. I haven't pursued volvo yet, I assume the dealers use remans in there's, do I purchase through the dealer, or can I goto another source? I google search didn't turn up any real info.3: if I find a local rebuilder to do it, are there any updates or changes to the internals that I should be aware of, so that I can make sure the rebuilder does them before I get it back? This trans is supposed to similar to the a toyota Aisin warner unit.4: From what I've read, a lot of problems are in the valve body, should I insist the builder install a new one?thanks and if anyone has any info that they'd like to send me that won't go through the IATN email system, then email me directly at andrew@notsoused.com or fax it to (901)-744-1051 ATTN: AndrewI searched the archives, and only found 1 post about the neutral engagement software update so, I'll be sure to create summary of my findingsthanks to all", "output": "andrew, it sounds as though you taught us something while you sought an answer from us. we thank you. you asked and answered the question at the same time. but thank you for sharing your thoughts. your knowledge helps all of us.\n\nandrew: Try VOLUPARS.COM. They are the best. Talk to William or Terry. Good luck.\n\nHello Andrew. In regards to where to to get the transmission. I would say get a reman from the dealer. As you are placing the order you can ask about the updates and downloads. If the parts person at the dealer knows what they are doing, they will offer this information to you without even asking. Good luck. Ed.\n\nCheck for SW upgrade first. As far as a reman unit goes, go with the Volvo reman. The quality is top notch and they always work. Also, worth the trouble to do a glycol check of the ATF.\n\nIs it a slipage issue or just a flare up between shifts. There is some update software for flare ups and harsh shifting, there is also a B4 servo update, that can cause several different issues. Any Codes in TCM?? There is some TNN's for this stuff find and read those, to be sure if these might be your problem, before the trans replacement. You didn't mention the 4-5 shift, so I take it is fine. I think it is always better to make sure SW is up todate first before you replace expensive parts. Yes you will need the VIDA tool to put the trans in Adaptive learn mode, There is a TNN on how to correcly drive the vehicle. Volvo is the place I would go for trans.\n\nI would definitly have software download done, this usually fixes 95% of the trans problems. There has been many software revisions, but the current version seems to be the best. As far as a reman. Go straight for the Volvo unit. No guess work on parts and has warranty.\n\n1. Yes, you are beyond a software update and you would have to have \"VIDA\" to perform it. The software only addresses the harsh engagement from a stop issue. 2. You will have to go straight to Volvo for a reman one, and if you do find one somewhere else , let us all know! 3. I have used \"BG\" transmission cleaner and then the \"BG\" synthetic fluid with great results on an S-80 that I was SURE was toast. Was any cleaner used before the tran fluid change? Did any one test the fluid BEFORE it was changed for GLYCOL contamination? Three out of four of the transmissions we have replaced in the last year tested positive for Glycol. There is a TSB on where to get the kit. The seal inside the radiator to the transmission cooler fails....if your friend doesn't want to replace a transmission TWICE....\n\nYes.. get the download from Volvo it should and probally will solve the problem. If not Erie Volvo Parts, Honest & good pricing they will have what you need and will back it up..\n\nandrew the nuetral control software which eleminates the nuetral control fuction should be downloaded if it was not already done and the transmission adaptive reset should be performed using any compatable scanner then you will need to take a test drive at moderate throttle stopping and going several times allowing the trans to shift through its gears also slow down slow allowing downshifts to happen until the trans shifts normal. this trans is constantly adapting so your goal is to get the shift points normal according to throttle position. as far as the best bet for a transmission i use the volvo reman unit and flush the cooler good. these units carry a one year unlimited mileage warranty or at least they did. if you find a rebuilder to do the job insist on a new valve body with wiring harness from volvo i replaced several of these at the dealer.\n\nNice \"FIX\" post.

I know you said the misfire went away.. but something to keep in mind.I have had the IAC fail on many of these. It moves, but just moves too slow to function properly.\n\nHave you check your Map sensor seen this problem before the map sensor has a O ring that seals it in the manifold that will sometime leak The PCM uses the map sensor for (manifold pressure) (injector pulse width) (engine load) (spark advance) and Decel fuel shut-off. as well as idle speed from the information you provided I would surely give it a look. I have a good idea you'll find your problem in or around that Map Sensor\n\nrun in shop 20-30 mins. w/ hood closed-open hood and tap on ecm-if stalls/stumbles shoot pcm. others are correct ckp very common and will not set code. did you ever have p0351(coil)?\n\nCheck the level of transmission fluid. Low transmission fluid will cause the torque convertor lock up to not release.\n\nreplace the idle control valve, look at your pid on scan tool , if IAC has no actibvity it has gone bad replace it\n\nRoger, have a Dakota 4.7 with similar issue that we replaced the IAC with an aftermarket part. Worked fine for a week and then the idle started to deteriorate again. Bottom line is you might want to try an OEM IAC before digging much further. Also, if you can get the issue to replicate then you can get a snapshot of the sensor outputs with a scanner and check to see if one of the sensors is dropping out or the converter is staying locked up when it stalls. HTH\n\nIs the EGR staying open on decel? Feel free to call if you like.\n\nis a kind of stall like you forgot to push in a clutch pedal at a stop i would lean towards torque converter lock up if thats the case or just a soft stall ,stumple stall i would lean towards crank position sensor hope this helps man good luck\n\nRoger have you verified the stalling condition? Any DTC codes with freeze frame data indicating conditions? Is it after a fuel fill up, poss. a purge valve issue? Did vehicle have a trans fluid service done? poss low on trans fluid and trans filter being loose. When stopping the TC clutch is engaging/engaged. Poss check TC clutch disengagement when applying brakes. If can verify concern try shifting trans into neutral and then coming to a stop, if engine does't stall poss a trans issue. Good luck.\n\ncheck the min. air flow . With the mileage the engine is getting a little weak and the setting may need adjusted. See it once in a while , stall in parking lot or coming to a stop. Steve\n\nHi there, well you have done most of what every one would do the next thing would be also to check all vacumms lines and the intake manafold for any leaks, as well the vacumm like going to the brake buster the check valve may be defective. If you have replace the crank sensor tps ams icv have been chec there is no much left also check the pcv valve you will be surprice as well the egr that is not open I have found carbon build up or it wont open or close. well good luck to you\n\ndo wiggle test on tps wiring at tps found lots of problems there and make sure throttle body is clean\n\nI'd scan the cam and crank sensors first to see if they are dropping out. By the way 405 is a dtc for egr which could definetly cause an intermittent stall out! They are a very common failure on most of the dodges! try blocking the flow off through the valve and redriving it and see if the stalling stops!\n\nyou need to look to the trans . problem could be that filter could be loosing prime & causing converter to go into lock up. you did not say if this is 4wd but if a 2wd filter was installed or the seal on the filter picks up air the trans will lockup converter when coming to a stop. (ihave seen this many times )\n\nI actually have a 2006 jeep commander 4.7 i'm fighting the same battle on. (it's listed on here if you would like to investigate) My customer has been driving it for a few days with the egr blocked off (as suggested by other members) and it has yet to stall. I'm going to have him do it for a few weeks and see if there is any change but i'm leaning toward an egr valve right now.\n\nMake some data recordings of the event if possible. Sometimes when it's graphed out you see something that doesn't make sense. May help you see if the PCM is really resetting.\n\nEgr valve sticking?\n\nHave you tried cleaning the throttle plate ? I have found even the slightest buildup can cause a dieng issue on coast down\n\nOne unusually odd problem on the 01 Durango I recall was with the purge solenoid. It would occasionally stick open and cause a P0442 (medium evap leak) code, but never to my knowledge had issues that transferred to the everyday driveability of the unit. That said, a purge solenoid that managed to stick open at an inopportune moment could overfuel engine engine at a time that it is vulnerable, which would be a lift-throttle decel event. With very little air being passed to the engine during these times, a mistake of that sort could cause a flame-out.\n\nOoops. I just remembered that the 01 Durango also had issues with a protruding bolt from the bulkhead that skewered the engine harness. Stalling occurred at odd times, but were tied to particular torque twist of the drivetrain, which may include decel. While this seems likely to have already acted up by now or NOT be the case, I just thought I'd send it along. Look in the area to the passenger side of the bulkhead for contact with one of these HVAC studs. It's not easy to see and will require a close look up from the underside.\n\nA couple of things come to mind. First, check ALL of your grounds closely. Had one do some really weird stuff and it was improper grounds. Crank sensors are really common on these also. Check the wave form when it gets hot. Have seen a couple of PCMs, but I would make sure all the powers and ground are good before throwing that at it. Good luck.\n\nTry to narrow down if stall is air/fuel related or ignition related by how it feels at stall. Air/fuel starvation is a slow death with warning signs. Ignition starvation is usually abrupt. Crankshaft endplay changes the position of vanes in relation to ckp. Ckp is usually the culprit. Decel ups the vacuum so look for leaks (intake?).\n\nI agree with Lee from NY-intermitant stall could be low trans fluit-had one bite me a few years back......now I always check fluid level. Lee is correct in that the tcc needs fluid pressure to release, if the filter sucks air, the pressure could drop enough to engage the clutch and cause stall.\n\nI had one of these once when the fuel pressure was only 2 psi under spec and when we came to a complete stop the engine would idle down and hit a low spot in RPM before picking up to target idle speed - so when this happened the fuel pressure, being 2 psi low, would cause a near die out and recover or sometimes a die out. Check fuel pressure numbers closely.\n\nIf none of these solve your problem, try another battery just to be sure.\n\nHave had similar problem on 4.7 jeep turned out to be O2 sensor, try doing a data capture on stall and see if one of you upstream O2's are popping up or over 5V.\n\nwhen it dies, does it flat out fall on it's face? or does it seem to idle rough then die out? does it ALWAYS restart right da way? Common issue i've seen on these cars are Crank sensor (becareful when u change them, they like to break off when removing and leave half of the sensor in the block, and you have to spend an hour drilling it) But bad CPS usually would have nothing to do with Accel or Decel relation. EGR valve is also common cause as well, try blocking it off and just drive with CEL on for a while. Bad Coolant temp sensor could throw the computer into Open loop and flood the engine. TPS is very common failure, but since u replaced it alrdy... then nm. also try tapping on the PCM.I've seen Trans failure on these truck as well, stuck torque convertor clutch. But I wouldn't go that far yet.\n\nIf you have a scan tool with recording or snapshot capabilities, you should record the stalling event and play back in a graphing mode. The fault may be revealed.\n\nI'd be looking for dirty throttle plate and/or sticky AIS. When intake is properly clean and with no vacuum leaks present I do believe the AIS count should be around 20 steps.\n\nI read your post multiple times to make sure I didn't overlook something; I don't see where you mentioned cleaning the throttle body. all chryslers have problems with that. the jeeps are the worst. I call this Idle undeershoot. the carboned up passages don't allow a smooth enough transition at idle speed and so it can die. it will start right back up. this is most common on a decel to stop, or when something cycles on while at idle. hthFrom: iATN-c011886814404dr@comments.iatn.net To: hummelsadc7@hotmail.com Subject: Chry-Drive-OBD2: UPDATE 01 Dodge Durango, Cuts-out/Stall Date: Wed, 25 Jan 2012 16:17:31 -08002001 Dodge Durango 4.7L Cuts out, Stall Click here to REPLY!UPDATE: sorry for the typo, i accidently wrote that the vehicle at one time had a p0405 code, that was a mistake it was a p0305 for cylinder 5 sorry about the confusion. that particular issue has been fixed. we are now just dealing with the intermintant stalling issue, no codes are present at this time.Roger has received (23) replies to his original message so far.ORIGINAL MESSAGE: hello everyone, we have a dodge durango with a intermittent stall ONLY on a deceleration to a complete stop, for example when coming to a stop light. we replaced the ignition switch a bout 2 weeks ago because we thought it was the problem because the radio would shut off for no reason and if you hit the key it would die.however the vehicle came back with the same problem. we also found out that the vehicle would intermittently set a po405 for a cylinder 5 misfire. and would run rough. so we swapped the fuel injector with another near by cylinder and the problem moved with the injector so we replaced that one, and now we have no more check engine light and the vehicle runs great besides still intermittently stalling at a traffic light.we cleaned the battery terminals, (battery tests perfect) reset all adaptives, min idle, min TPS, ect. vehicle still acts up. we tested the fuel pressure and it is always perfect.the TPS and IAC test perfect, but we have read multiple posts about them causing issues so we replaced them and reset all the adaptive again but we still have the intermittent stall.as of this time i really think that the PCM is causing all this, but i have not been able to find a accurate way of testing that theory with out just replacing it.i was just wondering if any of you Dodge Techs have any insight on this situation?TECHNICAL INFORMATION Engine:4.7 L / 8 cyl / Gas / SOHCFuel Delivery:Fuel InjectionTrans:4-speed Automatic Transmission (Electronic)Mileage:124,421 miEmissions:OBD-II CompliantVIN:1B4HR28N31 Symptoms:Cuts out, StallOccurs:Intermittently Offer a REPLY Read complete DETAILS Read any REPLIESCopyright \u00a92012 iATN.

Would you please explain how this can happen?I'm afraid the \"fix\" posted would not be helpful to *** anyone *** so I must rate it as such.\n\nJaime etc.Roger is spot on..When convertors face cavitation they often lock up extraneously ..Air in fluid (often simply caused by low levels) causes cavitation - cavitation causes inappropriate lock up - inappropriate lock up causes stallingI think Roger did a good job explaining - others have given the theory\n\nAnthony (& Roger & all), I'll research the phenomenon and if wrong will humbly apologize. If I find a reputable source that contradicts the \"fix\" I'll provide that information instead.\n\nMy sources: iATN Transmission Forums, ATRA.com, Motor Age, Mitchell Repair, GM eSI, Google, etc.My searches included the terms \"Cavitation\" and more appropriately, \"Aeration\" when I searched if either could cause (or allow) the TCC to lock. There were absolutely no findings that such a phenomenon can occur. There was mention that aeration can cause overheating of the Torque Converters which could lead to melted internal components and THUS permenantly cause a TCC to lock but otherwise, nothing that substantiates the claim.Can you provide facts from reputable transmission sources that would support it???\n\nI DO belive air in trans oil will cause this problem. It may sound weird, but making a logical reasoning it is possible!\n\nJaime - I like your skepticism - good for technicians to have a healthy dose of itI have seen it before - I know I am not dreaming .. but I should find a reference other than my own conclusions or what I think I read. Again I appreciate your skepticism.I am sorry I do not have time to do my homework exactly now rigorously but here are a few hits quicklytombirch.com/1/ppt/atstall.ppt - he alludes to the phenomena on page 3 - a cursory statement but he has the phenomena in mind obviously:\"Torque converter stall should not be confused with a transmission stall test. Torque converter stall occurs when a locked torque converter causes the engine to stall.TC Stall can be caused by low fluid level, faulty torque converter controls or internal seals.\"I know this is not sufficient - I do not claim to be a auto-tran-expert. However the way I have justified the conclusion is in recent years these things: Transmission fluid temperature Engine coolant temperature Throttle angle Engine speed Fluid characteristics (that affect temp and also when involved engine stall speeds)Now I leave you all this link http://www.justan...etting-ready-go.htmland bid my ado.\n\nive been in this business a very long time.tell me this is the first time something that sounded so wrong fixed the problem.from MY own experience aeration cause many different problems on different vehicles.why would he lie.buy a durango,loosen the filter and go for a ride,and you'll have a reputable source.have a nice day"}

Last month we serviced this vehicle for a stored C1225 code-left front wheel excessive speed variation. We scoped the front sensor and test drove the vehicle to confirm several small voltage spikes-violla! Seemed pretty basic since I've seen these before, so we installed a new premium wheel hub assy (BCA brand-not a cheapo part!) w/ an internal sensor. Cleared the rtc, road tested the vehicle, and delivered it. Seemed pretty basic untill today the vehicle comes back with a stored C1225 dtc-same thing! I did a quick road test with my OTC and scoped both front wheel speed sensors for comparision. Sure enough but intermitantly the left sensor spiked again. I know that I inspected the harness for proper routing and wear-all ok. Since this occurs part time I know I'll be chasing this one when the car comes back in. What I want to ask is there a common problem that these systems have that I am not aware of? I'm sure that the sensor could be faulty and the harness might even have an internal flaw, which I will try to test and confirm, but this failure seems pretty basic in nature. By the way, if I wsn't clear, the pattern didn't drop out-it spiked high!

If you cut it about ten inches from the end you will find one of the wires discolored. we keep a replacement in stock for these. Good luck.\n\nBob, This is very common problem. In checking the freeze frame on some of these abs failures most problems occured during parking or turning while moving slow. Just before you replace the bearing again, I would ck the resistance of your bearing at the connector and compare it with the opposite wheel bearing. If more than 1350 ohms or even close to it, replace w/ dealer part. If ok, get the ABS wiring kit from as Matt mentioned. Also, when replacing the bearing make sure that you torque the bearing assembly on the knuckle to spec, inadittion to the axle nut. Any movement beyond what is allowed (especially in parking meneuvers) the internal wiring will fall on its sword! Hope it helps.\n\nIts a pain but you need to swap wires at the module so that right is left and left is right. And drive till sets code. Then you will know if sensor is bad or wires. Is probably bad harness somewhere, and if you do repair harness dont forget to retwist wires.

Try jacking the front end up pretty high and see if it leaks with the engine off. Or is it only leaking when the engine is running. If its just the seal leaking from fluid not under pressure go at it like a normal seal leak, grooves in the yoke, rear bushings worn out, etc. This rear output shaft is part of the clutch for the transfer clutch. If the area only leaks with the engine running the transfer clutch housing may have a problem allowing transfer clutch fluid pressure to push out of the yoke or seal. Unique. I have one apart on the bench right now and the shaft into the clutch may be an issue however I have never seen this. How bad is it leaking. One other thing try, remove the dipstick and see if that stops it, there is a vent on the top of the front diff and pump area that could be plugged. I see them leak from all over when this vent plugs up or its rubber tubes are folded.\n\nHaven't seen too many of these leaking from the transfer section output seal. But they did have lots of problems with the transfer clutches chattering. There's a few TSB's on this.

There is really no hidden tricks. If you have a situation where the awd binds up on tight turns, then the duty solenoid should be replaced. The rear seal replacement is very straight forward.

Then I began to get a vibration in the steering wheel that progressively got worse as I drove the vehicle. Seemed like a classic problem with one or both calipers binding up when getting hot. I put the car on the lift and pulled all wheels.

If the issue is with master cylinder, it will almost do it all the time, flush the system, and recheck, Does this system have abs? If not I would upsale the master cyliner and the proprtioning valve due to age of car.\n\nDear Shaun,Check u caliper hoses.They will get old and fail INSIDE the hose,which will result in fluid being prevented from flowing back up the lines.This is a common problem that affects old cars with high milage.Hope this helps u out.\n\nUsually caused by a faulty master cylinder, not letting fluid back into the reservoir.

Because they BOTH became free when you released one, you also know that it is not a brake hose problem. ABS problems should not affect both front wheels simultaneously, since front wheels are actuated independantly. Your problem is therefore in the master cylinder. The pressure relief port in the master is being covered or blocked. The natural heat produced in the brake system is expanding the brake fluid during normal driving, but it has nowhere to go, so pressure is produced and the calipers are actuated. This is possibly caused by misadjustment (if adjustible) of the booster push rod, or the wrong part(master/booster/rod) has been replaced. I have encountered both situations, with the same problems you describe. I am ashamed to say that neither car was correctly diagnosed the first time it came into the shop. It's a curveball.

The CMP input or synch pulse tells the PCM where the piston is located. The PCM uses this information to know WHEN to fire the injector (CMP &/or RPM), to know when to fire the ignition coil (RPM &/or CMP) and as a part of the Base Pulse Width Calculation (BPW). Any cause of an inaccurate RPM signal to the PCM will cause an inaccurate calculation of BPW. LOAD is the most complex part of the BPW calculation on a speed density system. It is not simply the input of the load sensor. Load is a complex formula that considers BARO, MAP, IAT, VE, EGR. Any one of these measurements or inputs can skew the load calculation and BPW. Barometric Pressure (BARO) The BARO input gives the PCM information regarding altitude and weather. If the PCM didnt consider BARO up front it would have to use fuel trim after the fact to compensate for altitude. This would dramatically affect the ability of the PCM to accurately control fuel in all locations and weather conditions. BARO gives the PCM a head start on the load calculation. Most vehicles equipped with a speed density capture BARO using the MAP sensor at Key On Engine Off (KOEO) and in some cases at WIDE Open Throttle (WOT). On some early OBD-1 vehicles with turbo chargers the PCM would bleed manifold vacuum to the MAP during deceleration to take a BARO reading. Also some early vehicles used a separate BARO sensor that operated similar to a MAP but didnt include the vacuum hose to the manifold. Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) The MAP sensor measures the difference in pressure between the atmosphere (BARO) and the intake manifold. It's important to remember that the pressure in the intake does not equal the amount of air the PCM is trying to measure. The air we need to measure is the air in the combustion chamber. After all it is the Air Fuel Ratio (AFR) that is in the cylinder that matters. It is also important to know what the PCM is acutally measuring. It wants to know the mass or weight if the air in the cylinder, not the volume. The pressure in the intake manifold (MAP) represents the potential air that will affect the amount of air that enters the cylinder. When MAP is high, more air will enter the cylinder when the intake valve opens than when MAP is low. Map is the difference between BARO and Vacuum. In other words, BARO - Vacuum = MAP. WHen MAP is high, vacuum is low, and when load is high, so is MAP. Intake Air Temperature (IAT) The intake air temp sensor input helps the PCM determine the density of the air.Hotter air is less dense than cold airand therefore lighter requiring less fuel. Again as in the case of the MAP sensor, the temperature that is important is the temperature of the air as it enters the cylinder. Some manufacturers measure this directly by locating the sensor in the intake manifold while others measure this indirectly by locating the sensor in the intake air ducting. Coolant temperature is not used in the load calculation. It only affects the MPW and is only considered when cold or very hot. Volumetric Efficiency (VE) is the measuremnt of the cylinders ability to fill to its maximum. 100% VE on a 1.0 liter 4 cylinder engine means when the intake valve opens on each cylinder, 0.25 liter of air is entering each cylinder. VE is calculated and measured in the lab by the engineer and stored as a constant in the PCM as a function of RPM and MAP. This constant never changes in the PCM. However the actual VE of the engine changes over time and changes when the ehgine is modified to breathe better. Things that affect VE include: Carbon buildup in the intake manifold or on the back of the valves. Valve train wear. Exhaust restriction. Modifications to the engine such as camshafts or exhaust systems. Anything that affects the way an engine breathes. If you want more let me know.\n\nDoes it have high exhaust backpressure or low vacuum at cruise, even after the cat replacement? If so, it may have an exhaust obstruction due to the inner wall of the double wall exhaust pipe separating."}

With a manual guage, it has good pressure at idle until it gets hot, then the pressure drops off to 0 psi. As soon as you bring the engine above idle to about 1200 rpm, pressure comes back and quickly builds to the regulated pressure of 60 psi max. We dropped the pan and inspected the main and rod bearings as the customer requested and found bearings worn, most of them not too bad but a couple of the rod bearings had copper showing. We miked the rod journals and all were within specs. so we installed new main and rod bearings. That didn't help, so we put in a new oil pump. That didn't help either.

Aftermarket axles can cause this exact condition of vibration at idle when vehicle is stopped. Hth.\n\ncarefully put a jack under engine and or trans axle. raise slightly, if it helps mounts are bad or low quality. check for s decoupler type pulley on alternator.\n\nDo a relative compression test and see what the physical resistance of each cylinder is. A wrecked vehicle engine can bend a connecting rod during a high speed collision sudden stop event. It is rare, but it can happen. Also check for any exhaust bind or mount bind. Loosen bolts for them and tighten while the engine is running. I have resolved these mystery vibrations on several vehicles by doing this.Was the flywheel clocked correctly when installed? Some engines can have the flywheel simply bolted on and the external balancing will be off.\n\nJust to add to my previous post: Check all vacuum hoses and lines. A misfire/vibration at idle is common with a vacuum leak issue.If you check the intake because it had been possibly swapped (or upset), use a stream of water from a spray bottle and see if excess steam comes out of the exhaust. Smoke testing or carb spray often does not work effectively. I have found many idle misfire/vibration issues this way.Also, loosen the motor mounts and then remove the drive axle nuts. Push in the axles as far as you can and check for any notable difference. If there is, the motor may need to be shifted a little to correct the issue. (I had this happen on several models in the past, Honda was the worst for this issue).\n\nWas also going to mention aftermarket front axles will create a vibration.\n\nDid the old engine have this problem?If not, try swapping the mounts from the old engine to the replacement engine. ( I guess you could also do this to the vibration dampner).\n\nYou may be right about the engine being different...Wix lists two oil filters for 2011 Forester with a 4/2011 change date. Don't know what else changed. > >\n\nSES or not, I would first check if the problem is a misfire or mechanical vibration.I would try running it without the drive belts.A Sube pancake 2.5 should not have a balance shaft.I agree that you should try slightly lifting the running engine to see if the problem is lessened.\n\nNo engine should vibrate, right or wrong. Is it touching the frame somewhere? Exhaust secured properly ? Maybe something is bent - it's out of a wrecked car ? Mounts wrong type? So many things can cause this. They must be really good friends you are trying to help.\n\nAs Joe said, jacking in different places under the engine and transaxle can pretty definitively answer if this is a motor mount problem or something else. It's possible jacking might also make a bad/wrong axle vibration go away, so you might have to rule that out too.\n\nI believe that has a flywheel with a dampener in it. It sounds like the flywheel is bad. If the flywheel was replaced, it can be a balance issue also. I like the idea of putting the original mounts back in. That would be on my list. About the CVs being bad. That is a good idea but only applies to an automatic where the axles are loaded while the car is stationary. But if they are too long and pushing on the knuckle and the trans, that can create a vibration. That usually shows up as a vibration driving though. If it is easy to grab the axles and check that they can move a little end to end you will have checked that off the list. Make sure the first exhaust system joint is a flexible spring loaded joint and in good condition.At least you are troubleshooting an easy engine to get in and out! My guess is the flywheel, but we look forward to your solution.\n\nI have seen aftermarket rebuilt axles cause this issue with an automatic transmission when in drive and stopped (when the axles are under load). Yours is a 5 speed, however, it's worth looking into.\n\nHow can there be vibration from the axle shafts with the car not moving and idling? If it smooth off idle, it is not an internal engine balance issue. I go with the possible motor/transmission mount, or exhaust interference causing the problem.\n\nHave you checked the timing belt? I have seen belts jumping one tooth on impact. Also, clean throttle body. Carbon build up there can give idle problems.\n\nMore, this year Forester has a \u201cdual mass\u201d flywheel. Replacement is recommended, resurfacing does not work. Also it would be good to make sure that the timing belt shoe / guide is installed above the crank timing belt sprocket. It is designed to keep the belt from jumping teeth when parked on an incline. If parked without parking brake set, the load on the engine can collapse the tensioner. Then when the car is started, it can jump timing.\n\nIn reply to AJ and for general info: Take, for example, an axle that has a binding inner CV. When the auto trans is in drive with the car stopped, the normal engine vibrations can be transmitted to the suspension and chassis. It feels just like a bad motor mount. It probably (at least in my experience) will not be noticeable when driving. It may also be combined with a light vibration in gentle turns (freeway ramps), which is also typical of a binding inner CV. It doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2?\u00c2?t do the idle vibration on a stick car, because the axle is not loaded and so there is not a path or mechanical connection to transmit the vibration. I used to see this kind of vibration on the old Saabs with the inner CV tulip as part of the transmission. The fix was to remove them and swap left/right to get the rollers out of the grooves that were causing the binding.The other scenario I think some posters are alluding to is where the axles are too long and are impinged by the knuckle and the transmission. I have not seen that cause an idle vibration but have seen it cause a vibration or wobble when driving. It never hurts to see if the axles slide a little longitudinally. Looseningthe CV nuts and measuring how far they can move is the 'real' test.\n\nThe engine mounts could have been damaged during the swap.al\n\ncheck the upper strut behind the engine and make sure it isnt under a bind. Loosen and see if the motor relaxes into a new position."}

Replace the timing belt on this Elantra. Went to start it this morning for the first time since the repair. It started for 1-2 seconds, heard a thunk, and then sounded like there was no compression and it would not start thereafter. Removed the upper timing cover, set the lower crank pulley on TDC, and the upper timing marks are lined up in the proper order. When I turn the engine over by hand, it will only turn over half way and gets stuck when #2 and #3 cylinders are at top dead center in either direction. With a bore scope, it looks like there might be contact marks in the #3 cylinder on the piston. I don't understand what could have happened. The cam and crank were never turned when the timing belt was off and I painted the timing belt and the pulleys and lined everything back up exactly as the old belt. I know the valves most likely contacted the piston, but WHY! I don't want to fix the head if needed and then find out it's going to happen again. I've been an ASE Master tech for 25 years, done hundreds of timing belts, and have never had this happen. I'm hoping someone has seen this before and can shed some light. Thanks and God Bless.", "output": "pull valve cover and see if vvt chain / sproket / tensioner exploded. just a thought-good luck\n\nCheck for bent valves.Good luck.\n\nchange the chain sprocket tensioner, then re-do your timing marks, then do a compression test, hence bent valves !! ouch ..this one might hurt, i feel for you , you have by blessings on this on, know that feelinge\n\nDid either of the pulley pins shear and or the key way?\n\nSounds like the crank key way fell out\n\nRemove the pluga and bring #1 piston to TDC. Verify tour crank timing mark is still OK. I bet it is not. Could be stripped or missing key, dowel pin, etc. Seen this before and know kow you feel. I worked for an old Italian guy in the late 70`s and he would make sure I turned every engine 3 or 4 revolutions by hand after any belt or chain then recheck it before trying to start. I am in my 50`s and still do this. Has saved my A$$ a couple of times. The hard part is explaining the snafu to the customer.\n\nThat old Italian guy who gave William advice to turn the crank by hand after every step was a very smart old man. That extra step he told William to take isn't in any of the books, but it sure can pay big benefits. Sure it'a a pain in the ass and takes extra time, but if it saves one teardown it's worth it.\n\ncheck for broken or bent key ways. reintsall tensioner and belt cross your fingers and do a compression test.\n\neric; sounds like everyone is pretty much right on, but did you have the plugs out by any chance? have seen small pieces of hardware find their way down those holes with bad consequences. richard\n\nHave had bad crank keys shear off on these. When your pulling your head to put valves in take a close look. Sorry about the luck!\n\nsounds like a broken dowei pin or key i know the felling been there before good luck\n\nTiming marks on this engine for TDC : cam sprocket \"A\" at 12 o'clock and crank key at 9 o'clock, only other problem i've seen is rubber seals for timing cover coming out of place on re-install and making the belt jump but you say timing marks are lined up still?\n\nI know that there may be two marks on the camshaft pulley. are you sure it did not move from valve spring tension?\n\nwhere are the timing marks located on the cam, and the block\n\nI usually do what Allan said. Errors happen and catching them before disaster happens is #1 to me.\n\nI agree with the others here. I've seen this before where the alignment dowel pin or key way has sheared and everything appears in time but in reality when you remove the belt and pulleys you find a sheared pin or key. Good luck.\n\neric ,feel your pain-but let's keep it simple.let's forget timing marks. To verify time at TDC(measured piston top of stroke) intake lobes should point to 10 o'clock - similarly exhaust should point to 2 o'clock on #1 cylinder. e-mail direct if questions as you used your update if you like.cliff\n\ndouble check to alignment mark on the crankshaft if the cams are dead on the crank had to out of time. if you cant find a good picture of the timing mark i can email you one if you need it reply to kiakid2007@yahoo.com\n\nHave not seen a problem with these belts as long as the proper procedure has been followed. I note that you painted the pulleys and set crank pulley at tdc. and felt that the pulleys did not move when old belt was removed. In my experience, valve spring pressure on these always rotates one of the cams. Proper procedure is to use the marks provided on the pulleys by the manufacturer. The chain between the cams should have two different colored links that will match up with the dots on the cams when in proper position. As this is acomplished while matching the main cam pulley - head marks it is a bit of a pain in the rear! It does not require much to be slightly out of time and bend valves on these engines. As others have said, ALWAYS rotate engine at least two complete revolutions by hand and recheck timing marks. As a former Hyundai tech working with these multi cam setups daily, that has proven it's worth for me many, many times as it is not always easy to see all the marks from the same angle to determine if they are lined up properly. One tooth on a cam can be enough to do it in! All the same tech info that we had as a factory tech is available to you from the Hyundai website. Just sign up for a free membership. BTW. If you are going to have your head repaired, make sure that none of the valve guides or valves are cracked. Have seen some of these, usually the 2.4l's with valve faces broken right off , guides destroyed and broken pistons after failure on the freeway.\n\nI just did a rav4 and the engine builder set the exhaust cam to a mark that said exh. The cam gear had 3 marks exh, int, and a dot. Well for the 1 I was working on it needed to be set to the dot.Just as a point to be able to see what is happening set up a degree wheel. It could be as crud as a piece of card board so you have an idea of where the piston is at. Now turn over by hand and compair what the valves do to where the piston should be. I see some engines that have what looks like timing marks but they aren't.\n\nHad one towed into work about a year ago, no start and cranked over like it had no compression. Checked timing belt and timing marks and were ok. Something malfunctioned with the Variable Cam Timing, and the engine had low compression. Ended up installing a used engine.\n\nCheck the timing belt you took off and compare it to the \"new\" one. Are the tooth counts correct?\n\nl know that you have check your cam marking and main pulley marking but you must not mistakely check the pulley marking due to pulley loose due to loose pulley rubber.dismanstle the first spark plug to turn the engine to the tdc,to confirm the pulley marking. thank you\n\nI had a similar experience on a civic a couple of months back. We reinstalled a belt that a do-it-to-yourselfer had installed incorrectly. Afterwards it ran ok and we told him it was ready. The next morning I went to start it for him and it sounded like the belt had jumped, no compression and you could hear the valves tapping the pistons. We knew it hadnt run in a couple of years but the engine seemed ok and the fuel didnt smell that old. We pulled the valve cover and all the exhaust valves were stuck open. You could not move them. We even tried tapping on them with soft drift, they were siezed. It didnt make sense. So I put it back together after rechecking the timing marks and just cranked it while spraying brake clean down the intake. It started up one cylinder at a time, then idled pefectly. We drove it around, put new fuel in it after draining the tank and kept it over night. The next day it did the same thing. We tried top end cleaner, injector cleaning, Sea Foam, nothing helped. So we just kept driving it and it got progressively better. I read that the ethanol leaves a deposit on top of the valve guide under the seal that basically glues the exhaust valve to the guide when it cools off. The small displacement engines with weaker valve springs seem more susepctible to this. Seems to be worse with old fuel. Hope this helps. Paul.\n\njust wondering when you frist set timing marks is it possable you turned engine in oppsite direction causing vvt on cam to move or unload,not sure if that on works on oil pressure or not\n\nIf the vehicle has been sitting for a few months or longer it is possible that the fuel turned to varnish and stuck the valves. I ran into this several years ago.\n\nI'm not sure that I will give you a great answer. Your timing MUST be off. Turn it over by hand and watch your pistons come up and your valves go down. All 4 exhaust valves can be bent if it cranked a few revolutions. I always turn an engine over by hand before starting when doing timing belts. That way you know if something is binding.\n\nIn your original Reply you said that you set the Crank to TDC after you started it but did not mention resetting the cams. You mentioned the marks lining up? Which marks EVERY mark? If the belt was on and they all Lined up then I would be stumped as well. Did you ever rotate the Crank or Cams with the belt off? I think the answer your looking for is within the \"installation procedure\" and not what you did after. As you did not post that it is all theoretical.-Either you turned the Cam/Crank without the belt on 1 full revolution or 2 full revolutions for Crank. -You did not time it from scratch and your marks that you made were ambiguous and the cam moved without noticing. -The tension was set improperly on the belt and caused it to slip. Those are the biggets mistakes I see done.Experiance comes from working on these motors in the early Tiburon models. The 2.0 Beta.\n\neric; wow! that's a humungus piece of carbon! could it have come from an egr passage? perhaps it broke up and ran through the intake manifold on that bank and out the exhaust - holding valves open temporarily. about 40 years ago my vw blew up on the garden state parkway (nj). even though I shut it off the second i heard a noise, when i took it apart the metal was everywhere - each cylinder had shrapnel from dropping the valve on the #3 piston. and those were long manifolds from bank to bank. richard\n\nHave had similar problems with Honda in the past. Not after timing belt change, but just a cold morning restart. Honda even had a notice of it happening in their service news. I personally witnessed and fixed two Accords on separate occasions. What would happen is that the valve stems would gum up over time and after sitting in the cold they would actually stick open and stay open as the engine was cranked over cold. The \"cure\" according to Honda was to introduce while cranking a intake cleaner into the engine through the the intake manifold, let it sit ten minutes and start the car. You could actually hear it picking up compression one one cylinder and the next as you introduced the cleaner. In both cases I encountered the cars had just done a trip across state with no problems the day before. They turned off the key after the trip, and on the next restart it lost all compression. I figured the trip heated up and melted the deposits on the valves and when the engine cooled it set up like glue. Once a valve got opened it stayed open.Saw it on a Volkswagen 8 valve motor once too. Same cure. I expect we may see this more on direct injection engines soon due to lack of valve cleansing from fuel passing by."}

The problem that we are adressing in class are spongy brakes. The wierd thing is the fluid appears to get sucked back up into the bleeder valve (especially on the front sides) as we tighten the bleeder (student is holding brake pedal down). The calipers in the back have good flow through the bleeder (no suck back up). The flow through the bleeder --in front-- on both sides is not good (we get fluid to come out, but not much). The brake pedal is nice and firm when the car is not running. As soon as we start the car the pedal goes to the floor (it won't pump up). After going through the knowledge base I saw a posting that eluded to the ABS modulator valve but starting to think it might be bad brake booster? Any suggestions? Your help is greatly appreciated by myself and my students", "output": "First what do you mean sucked back up into the bleeder screw!!?? I have never heard of that! And what was the original problem that you were fixing? You don't say! New master cylinder and bleeds the brakes four times! Did you replace the calipers? if so are they on the right side this will give you a spongy pedal!! What else was done to the brake system? Also some of the Chrysler cars require the use of the DRB3 to perform an ABS brake system bleeding procedure! did you Do this? Have you bleed the system with the car running? And to finish only air in the system will give you a spongy pedal or a fluid bypass in the master cylinder which will cause the pedal to drop but still you will be able to pump it up! And i i to would be loosing confidence in you if you are thinking brake booster \"EVRYONE KNOWS THAT A BAD BOOSTER WILL GIVE YOU A ROCK HARD PEDAL NOT A SOFT ONE\" \"I've been an auto tech for some tweenty eight years and have never seen a bad booster give you a soft pedal\" i am also ASE certified in brakes as well as Chrysler certified for some of the past seven years on Chrysler Dodge and Jeep products! and a stae inspector as well! Hey maybe i need to be an instructor!!!! yeah right\n\nto properly bleed this system, you will need at least a factory scan tool (DRB III)to bleed the hcu portion of the brakes. i don't know if any other scan tools are capable because i've never used any other type. other scan tools might, i just don't know which ones. the factory service manual has a very specific procedure that i have been successful using to bleed these style brakes. hope that helps\n\nHi John I can tell you this { Although it's been some years, Since I cut 1 apart ;>?? ;>} The booster is just a housing, with a \"Solid\" rod running through the middle of it & a return spring on the rod & a Diaphram { think Balloon } attached to the rod in the middle of it... the vacuum on the 1 side Helps the brake pedal to be pushed... IF the Diaphram IS leaking ;>? You will Usually Hear it ;>?? But with the Solid rod in between the pedal & M/C. there Shouldn't be ANY back flow movement of the M/C piston.... Is the Same student holding the pedal All the time ;>?? \" Getting the Teacher \" ;>??? Letting up on the pedal ;>??? Other than this ;>?? I Wouldn't think the booster... You can Also bleed the pedal with the motor OFF... This will eliminate the booster... Some of these ABS systems Won't bleed without the \" Scan tool \" to operate them... the way around this is to go do some Panic stops to operate the ABS & then rebleed.... Personal Experience... When ever I'm doing a brake hydraulic system, I plug the lines, just a vacuum hose with a bolt { Golf Tee } in it, to loose as Little fluid as possible & then \" Gravity \" bleed it to fill what I have replaced... This works Most of the time.... The Less you let Out, the Less you will Fight getting it Full Again ;>}}} I also have a \" Mighty Vac \" brake bleeder, that I remove the bleeder & wrap the threads with \"Teflon tape\" & this will suck the fluid through the lines.... I also have a \" Phoenix \" Reverse bleeder, which I use to change from dot 3 to dot 4 fluid... This 1 Also Requires the bleeder to have the threads wrapped with Teflon tape, to keep the fluid from mixing with the air through the bleeder threads... There Are some Cheap 1 way bleeder systems \" Valves \" out there... But any 1 of them WILL Need to have the threads of the bleeder bolt wrapped with Teflon tape to keep the air from bleeding past the threads.... Another 1 I Have Seen ;>?? Sometimes the calipers will get placed on the Wrong side & the bleeder will be on the bottom of the caliper... Air WOn't come out of the bottom.... Bleeder Must be on TOP of the calipers.... Hope Something in here Helps with your Puzzle ;>?? K.P.\n\nJohn, I would not suspect the booster if you have good pressure at the back, I'm more inclined to believe your problem is in the modulator. I would say the proportioning valve is the main problem, but if my sources ( and memory) are correct, the proportioning valve is incorporated in the modulator. Hope this helps you, good luck."}

It could be contaminated. I don't really think it is since only the rears are locking, but it is a place to start. I would say that your issue is in the right rear. The ABS is seeing the right rear lock while the rest are moving at the same speed. Check the brake hose, and caliper on the right rear.

If the right rear is that much higher or lower then the rest you will be able to see it. This will turn on the TC. You can also monitor the ABS solenoids to see which wheel is activating. Use a two channel scope and monitor the rr and lr at the same time. Sorry for the first post, I did not rear the reply part of your message.

Point me in a different direction guys thanks.", "output": "Hello Sam,If you have an IDS or equivalent scan tool, monitor the VCT FAULT PIDs.

If they do, while monitoring the PIDs tap and wiggle the electrical connector. I have seen some electrical connector issues. They are available through the dealer.Hope this helps. God bless, Mike\n\nNot sure about this Lincoln. But on most vehicles you test the phaser while the timing chain OFF. Apply shop air to the oil port.\n\ntwist the phasers and there should be no movement...lock pin play and rivet play could be your issue...labscope with a known good waveform is the best way to test\n\nYou said \"milky oil\"? Does it have water in the oil? Or did you mean to say you checked and none found. Milky oil usually will condemn one of these engines.A scope is needed to get a good picture of the patterns for the cams and crank. A stretched chain, bad guides and worn gears are very likely.The dealer probably said it needed a motor due to mileage and age.If customer decides repair... don't go with cheap parts. Aftermarket parts are very poor quality.Next option would be a quality low mileage engine if one can be found.\n\nHad a Taurus bite me in the u know what with codes after chain and water pump job. Turned out even though all cams locked and all marks lined up the aftermarket water pump was the issue. Too big or small of diameter just a fraction but enough to throw cam timing off 1 bank.\n\nthe phaser is locked at idle so you may have a solenoid stuck open but it relative compression is off on one bank 1 could have a timing issue even a cam crank waveform would help to prove it 100 percent hth\n\nWhat is the oil pressure at idle?\n\nMilky oil is a big issue for sure, as it indicates contamination from coolant. I would not have tried to band-aid this as the cause for the oil contamination has not been addressed.Oil pressure hot, at idle, is what you need to check, should be above 25PSI. Anything less, means you've got an internal oiling issue.Whenever timing components are changed, the gears must be changed also, as they get knife-edged and make the new chain instantly 'loose' and will cause the new chain to wear out very quickly. You numbers indicate that the engine has an issue at idle that goes away as pressure increases...\n\nIf you are sure of the timing, then you should scope the cam signals with the crank to see what is going on. Wonder if a phaser reluctor arm got bent?\n\nHave the cams reset? Having VVT, if the oil screen is dirty, that would cause low RPM issues preventing the cams from resetting and allowing good driving at higher RPMs. Might not hurt to triple check clean oil, proper viscosity and a clean screen to allow the oil driving the cams to evacuate.\n\nI did not think about this before. Is this just in the scanner data when checked but there is no check engine light?What is known has Mode 10 will do this. This is a mode that was developed to keep people from using \"pocket scanners\" to clear codes and cheat emission testing.It might help, also t0 contact a Ford/ Lincoln dealer service writer, if you know one. Have them enter the VIN and mileage for you vehicle and see if their are any \"hits\" pertaining to this pesky code.Another thing to consider is always use a factory OE water pump on these things. Look at the archives.\n\nWith timing solenoids disconnected, your cam degrees should read the same on both banks. If not, cam timing is probably off. You stated \"dots\" lined up. You need cam timing tools to set these engines. Cam,and crank gears are not keyed/pinned to cams, and must be reset, after installing new parts. There are updated phasers for alot of them, so if you go back in, Replace them, along with new washers. Hope this helps.\n\nHindsight is 20/20 most times but I have learned my lesson about reusing phasers on jobs that I'm going into the chain on. I recomend to the customer to replace them. If they choose to roll the dice then it's their gamble. I suggest you go back in and bench test your phasers or just straight replace them."}

The harness insulation degrades due the the heat and where it runs under the intake manifold. I have played with the harness and sensors after the repair, but haven't had them give any sign of failure. Hope this helps.\n\nMy thought was to substitue new wires PCM to knock and try that. I know knocks get shielded wires but for testing purposes I don't see why not if it's just to see if the car can get to 5K rpm for a second or 2. Good luck.\n\negr assembly (sensor) is a common problem- toyota released a modified version to fix\n\nis the cat plugged ,what about fuel volume\n\nis the cat plugged ,what about fuel volume\n\nwhat is your fuel pressure when this happens. snap on makes adaptor screws into top of fuel filter in place of banjo bolt. or will screw into fuel rail cross over pipe. also have seen damaged crank gear cause this if one tooth is mising or slightly distorted it will make ecm see double actual rpm and kick in rev limiter. fuel pump is easy to get to has acess plate under back seat. check the pump sock. as for knockl sensor it is the sub harness under intake manifold has degraded. runs from sensors to main harness is ava from toyota. also get upper and lower intake gaskets. and may want to change spark plugs when manifold is off and valve cover gaskets. we call it the full meal deal.\n\nI've seen this before. Had to replace the harness section under the intake as well as the sensor. Played it safe and replaced both sensors. There is a tsb in toyota's TIS that identifies the harness as a failure part. car fixed... happy customer\n\nHi Sam One thing to try would be to unhook the wire connectors from the knock sensor and computer. Then check for continuity between the wire shielding and wires. There should be none. Some times the shielding will break up and pierce the wire it is shielding. Worth A try. Good luck Mike\n\ndid you check the crank gear itself for any teeth damage\n\nHi Sam,if your getting 51 to 58 in the fuel pressure when acting up it sounds like a vacum problem or a fuel regulator problem to me,test with a vacum gauge at the pressure regulator and see what the reading is when acting up,good luck Sam..\n\nSam, this is reminding me of a couple of cars in the past that had a plugged fuel filter. They would drive fine at low to moderate throttle, but get yer foot in it they just stopped acclerating around bout 4k. Both though they had bad transmissions cause it wouldnt shift either and one got $3k of trans work before I got to it. Your fuel pressure will be fine, but volume suffers. I like to see a pint in about 10 to 12 seconds. Or if the filter isn't that hard to get to, just yank it and try to blow through it. In theory you shouldn't. If it is plugged, better think about a fuel pump because thats alot of strain on it. Have fun!\n\nI most definitely agree with checking fuel volume first, but I also wanted to throw this out there.. I think it may be important to investigate this knock sensor code. When you get the symptom to happen, watch the knock sensor on the oscilloscope. I would watch and see if the signal becomes very irratic and may actually be sensing some real knocking. If you feel it is in a fail safe mode, is it a possibility that the ECU is retarding ignition timing and/or cutting fuel injectors? Watch those pids on the scan tool. Could there be pinging? Could this be caused by a fault in the EGR system? What are fuel trims? Good luck, Sam. I hope you solve it. -Aaron\n\nattach the scanner and watch or graph the o2 sensors while it does the issue to see if you are in fact going lean.\n\nOn the V6 Toyota and Lexus almost 99% of the time when you get a knock sensor codes. you will have to replace both knock sensors and the pig tail wire for it. Aso check the ground wires on the back of the intake and on the side of the intake, this will do alot of wird thing.\n\nSam have you checked your timing? has some one replaced the timing belt?\n\nhave u checked for clogged catalytic converter.\n\nAre the knock sensor codes coming back on? I've seen dirty maf sensor cause engine not to be able to rev up.\n\nI've only seen one of these but it led me down the same path as you're going. Thank goodness for tech support and watching scan tool data. It was the timing advance going into the retard mode from a bad ecm, not knock sensors. They were reading the retard condition and doing there job. It seems the 93-99 Lexus and Toyota ECM's are becoming unreliable and making us chase ghosts. One member here said open the ECM up and look closly for the capacitors leaking onto the boards. The last ECM we had (stalling cond)we did just that, but looked perfect inside. A new/used ecm fixed that car! So it's a crap shoot on that one."}

Car runs great with no symptoms other than check engine light illumination. With codes cleared you can drive this car at cruising speeds. As it transitions from 8 cylinders to 4 cylinders the scanner pid shows all MDS solenoids to be in \"active\" state. If they remain active for a period of 2 to 3 minutes the light illuminates and sets P3441 and shuts MDS system down every single time. Even though oil pressure was good we installed a new oil pressure sensor. Scan tool can toggle each MDS solenoid and they make good click sounds. We reluctantly replaced all four MDS solenoids even though original ones could be toggled. Test drive revealed same issue so we ordered factory PCM-(wrote vin mileage and downloaded files to new PCM). Test drove again and has same issue. Chryslers website seems to indicate that code P3441 is strictly electrical in nature and not mechanical.

Fire customer that do not want to pay, they are not worth keeping.Jim Garrido Saturn of Winston Salem NC\n\nI'm willing to bet that the transaxle has internal mechanical damage, not electrical. Just about every electronically-controlled transmission in the world will go into a mechanical fail-safe mode: meaning, if you remove all electrical control power from the unit, it will still have 1 forward gear (usually 3rd gear) and 1 reverse gear. This fail-safe mode will allow the vehicle to be driven as long as the engine still runs. My point is this: the reverse function on a transmission is almost always a mechanical function, not electrically driven. The odds of seeing passages (in the valve body) blocked so that it can't function in reverse are slim to none. I'm willing to bet either a band or a one-way clutch unit has failed internal. I'm NOT an expert by any means on a saturn transmission, just speaking as a general rule of thumb. Doug Kerslake CMAT(L1) Atlantic Auto Supply and Service 3562 N.

First of all check if the second gear solenoid is operating. needs to be grounded by PCM to turn on. Have seen some issues with broken wires near valve body cover( where wires to valve body go under A/C hose) The most likely possibility though is a loose input shaft nut. Remove the end cover. The input shaft nut is the nut inside the clutch housing. Saturn has a fixture to hold the shaft while tightening nut.

It has to do with engine rpm, and how much fuel it takes on each cylinder to maintain the rpm speed for that cylinder. So if your having misfires on cyl #4, even though Your no feeling any misfires. You might have a fuel injector problem. It's worth your time to take a look at it that way. I hope this might help. Good luck\n\nif your misfires are at idle and go away at higher rpms with no other problems indicated, test cyl with miss for leak down thru valves and running compression compared to a good cyl.\n\nohm out the injector, and the wires, it could be partially clogged as well. I have seen bad plugs and tracking on bad boots. If you swap any of those around does the misfire move with it? Is the contact to the coil tight/loose? any chance of a broken valve spring/bad cam lobe? Leak down test result? to eliminate the possibility of a leaking valve to be certain...\n\ndo a fuel injector balance test with tech2 or other scan tool with this feature. you probably have a partially restricted injector.\n\nI agree with others as well. Also may have the start of cam lobe or lifter roller issues.\n\nBefore doing anything, try removing serp belt- if counter persists then do crank relearn\n\nwhat are the actual conditions when the counter shows the #4 misfires? temp, load etc?\n\nHad the same issue Crank relearn fixed it Fast and easy to try\n\ntry swapping 2 injectors and see if misfire follows injector moves\n\nHad one similar. Was a weak valve spring. A vacuum gauge showed only a slight wiggle and not enough to think it was a problem. This would only count misfire at idle with the a/c on. Could not feel misfire only watch on tech 2.\n\nI would do a running compression test and compare to another cylinder. Could be valve or valve spring problems. If that tests good I would swap injectors and see if that changes the location. Usually a injector problem will be more evident at idle rather than at higher rpm speeds.\n\nI would do a crank relearn first. If that doesn't work, test the injector. Ohm it and/or swap to another cylinder and see if the problem moves. I have seen earlier versions of this motor wear the push rods into the rocker arms so bad that the valves would barely open. Maybe it isn't pulling in enough intake air or fuel to work normally. Good luck.\n\nAlong with the other information, you might want to do a complete computer reset.Disconnect the Positive cable at the battery and touch it to the ground for a minute or so. This will drain all the capacitors and reset the modules.HTHY\n\nCheck to see if there is a PCM update. The computer may be too sensitive and setting the code and there may be an update that will solve the issue.\n\nI'm sure others will tell you what i would also do is try a crank relearn before anything else @ see if that corrects the problem.\n\nDo you have a lobe on the cam going off?\n\nmay have the start of cam lobe or lifter roller issues.\n\nNo lifter or cam noise?does the rocker feel rough on either number 4 valve runner with cover off using a wood handle?

All back together, good oil pressure but lifters were still loud. In went a new set of lifters - no change. Camshafts, cam bearings and lifter holes looked ok. Since the noise seems to be coming from the end farthest from the oil supply to the head, and we have good oil pressure in the block (measured at the turbo oil feed), I'm guessing that oil flow to the head is restricted by the same crud that fouled the oil pickup screen. Of course there's no easy way to test this theory. Has anybody worked out a technique for cleaning these passage? Oil gets to the head via one headbolt hole (chain end, intake side). I'll be taking that headbolt out and taking the oil pump off next. The stuff that we found in the pan was hard crud, not soft sludge, so compressed air alone might not do it. If anyone has had any success doing this, I'd like to hear about it. If you think I'm wasting my time, write and tell me what I should do instead.

Saab says loosen the oil supply bolt on the far end intake cam to help purge air from the lifters. Never tried it myself. I would just pull the bolt like you already stated, and then crank the engine with the plugs out to see if it will clear out.\n\nbart, this engine is junk. lack of oil changes kills these engines. i would not spend to much time trying to repair due to crappy maintainance. oiler tubes are probably full of sludge, lifters are most likely permanently collapsed.\n\ncould the noise you are hearing be scuffed cylinder walls and piston skirts? a boreascope would be handy!"}

Make sure the throttle body is clean and the Idle Speed Motor is properly adjusted. Make sure the V.S.S. is not leaking trans fluid when disconnecting the wiring harness connector from the sensor. (A Dodge service manager told me that) Check that the pick up coil in the dist is not covered with oil, or that the vanes are not hitting the pick up. The dist shaft can wear, causing the vanes to hit. Make sure the PCV valve is not worn, causing a vacuum leak. Oh ya.

Special tools are required to properly install the block bushing.The symptoms are erratic timing, burst spark knock, etc, esp. when cold. All of this is covered in a TSB from 1993 or so.Tom Showers Certified/Specialist Chrysler Technician ASE CMAT, L1 Sawyer Motors Saugerties, NY\n\nCheck and see if the divertor valve is switching from upstream to down stream air. Many times the solonoid that causes this switch is bad causing up stream air to blow on the O2 sensor creating a false lean condition. Remove the air hoses from the divertor valve and see if the air going up stream or down stream. When the engine is cold the air should not be blowing on the O2 sensor.

Higher engine speeds mask the leak due to overlap and general speed of operation. 146K time to do a compression test- or use a vacuum gauge connected to a good central vacuum source. If the vacuum gauge needle vibrates/jiggles it is telling you there is a valve problem. Compression test for specific cylinder. Watch the first jump of the gauge- it should come up 75%, or more, of the total reading. This tells you the condition of the valve sealing. throttle open or closed isn't going to change the first reading, but some recommend WOT.

When you install the belt make sure there is no slack in the belt between the cam and crank on the non tensioner side.

Manual and automatic marks are different!!! just a note. Look at you literature. Do note use the front cover and the crank pulley as a reference, it is very easy to be off on these cars if you do it this way. Marks will be dead on if you use the flywheel marks. Other things that come to mind....cam keys bend/break inside cam...see this a lot even without broken belts. Cam chain in rear of the head is out of time. But if these things are out of time you will know it. Even 1 tooth you will know right away. Also, if there is a cam sensor problem or exciter ring pick-up/problem, i'm pretty sure these things go into limp mode. You can drive it but won't get out of its own way.

There is PROBABLY a pressure regulator in the pump assembly to dump pressure in case of pump control malfunction but have never had an issue that caused me to research that.

Using a couple of hose clamps, clamp off the three flex hoses and see if how the brake pressure feels, if it is still the same spongy peddle than i would either start with bleeding you master cylinder or replace it. your red BRAKE lamp doesn't have to be on if the master cyl is on its way out or even sometimes gone. 2.With all 3 flex hoses clamped off have some one in the jeep and hold the brake peddle down and one at a time release the clamps starting with the rear flex hose and see how much the peddle drops when the clamp is removed, if the peddle doesn,t move that much go to the right front and remove that clamp and see how much it drops then that should drop quite a bit seeing the front brake system does two thirds of the jeeps stopping,and then the same to the left front hose. 3.The one other thing that comes to mind is you said that the wheel cylinders are ok by that do you mean they are not leaking the bleeder screw works and your able to get plenty of fluid out when bleeding ? If the master hold a solid peddle with all three hose clamps locked down with absoultly no fade then you should check and be sure your wheel cyls are not frozen and are able to travel out enough to make the brake shoe contact the brake drum.the other thing if your rear brakes are not working and the jeep is hard stopping some time the front pads if they have been replaced with in the last few months are defective and should be replaced I have alot of pads come through extra extra hard causing the unit to have a very hard peddle and also almost imposible to stop. other than these few little tips i would have to see iand drive it my self GOOD LUCK . WWW.QUALITYUNDERCAR.COMRonnie CCHIRICHIELLO'S QUALITY UNDERCAR EXPERTS\n\nrick--sounds like the proportioning valve--also make sure the brake lines to the rear are not crushed. if the master was bad-your right the differential light would on--also the pedal would be low. dont forget the rear brakes dont work as hard as the front and only get warm usually---not hot. goodluck. terry\n\nI would check the flow from the rear rubber brake hose. It is possible that someone has crushed the line with vise grips or something. You never know what someone has done before you get the vehicle. You are right in that those proportioning valves hardly ever go bad, but it is possible. I would also pull the line for the rear brakes lose at the mastercylinder and have someone push the brakes just to see if you are getting a good flow of fluid. Good Luck Wayne - Cherokee Automotive\n\ndo you have good presure at the rear when you bleed them ?do you pump bleed or stroke bleed ? Can you make the lite come on if you leave a bleeder loose and pump? The porportionit valve will sometimes stick in the valve and requres you to open afront bleeder and JUMP on the pedal , it may come loose but if you can make the lite go on and off by opening a bleeder then it should be ok. If you short the wire to ground the lite shoud come on. Maybe its not working and the valve is stuck"}

Customer complaint is that he states \"the engine is running hot, gauge farthest to the right is reaching max.\" With initial inspection we first noticed the temp gauge is more towards the middle and that thing is steady in the normal, has not ran hot at all, coolant level/condition good. The gauge farthest to the right is the oil pressure gauge and as you rev the engine the needle does peak at 5bar hitting about 3k RPM. At idle we're seeing about 2-3 bar, (just noticed its at 5bar right now that i cold started it, as i'm posting this.) Per the owners manual the gauge is supposed to be in the 3.5 bar range running at 5k RPM. So, to me it doesn't seem normal. We explained to customer what we were seeing. Had him authorize oil pan r&r and oil pressure test to see if we find anything out the norm. Posting this prior to tearing into it to see if you guys seen anything common to cause this pressure gauge to read soo high? Its been about 10 months and 8k miles since his last oil change with us. So we will definitely be changing that when we put the pan back on.Seperate note, he states he tied his canoe to the top of his car (who ties crap on top of a porsche like its a tahoe, someone with more money than common sense obviously) and somehow he lost a strap, and is now concerned with a burning smell, thinks the strap got swallowed by the engine, how da hell, idk. What I do smell is the beautiful odor of burnt clutch, am i correct in assuming by adding all that weight to the car it would cause the clutch to overheat? Didn't find any burn marks on the exhaust or anywhere on the engine. The car runs great, no oil leaks at all. Its a very low mileage car but that means nothing if its not driven right. We haven't really punched it on the highway in fear of that oil pressure reading being true and blowing out a seal or something. Any info, greatly appreciate it. Thanks.Rob Del Rio M&R Car Import Svc. Chicago, IL GO BULLS!", "output": "First make sure you have 0W-40 oil.

I have a '99 911 here and while the owner's manual says the same thing as yours I can't help but think that it is a misprint or mistake. When this car is started cold with 0W-40 oil it reads 5 bar at idle. When warm it shows under 1.5 bar at idle. When run at 5,000 RPM the pressure goes up to 5 bar. Every water cooled 911 I work on has about these same results.\n\nJust to eliminate and weird gauge problems, I would put an actual pressure gauge on the engine to verify the accuracy of electric gauge. The oil pump is located on the back of the engine, rt. side. You can pull the pressure relief valve out from the bottom and check to be sure it is not stuck.\n\ni think this car starts with a jerk"}

Edgar V\n\nCharlie, You need to see if you have continuity in the switch positions. Put power to the proper pin and you should get turn signals. If you don't, you have a bad switch. I recently had a Mitsubishi in here that had no parking lights. I suspected the switch and went as far as to sell a replacement to the customer but once I got into it, I put power the pins and the switch worked, it was a power supply problem from inside his aftermarket alarm system. I ended up just cutting the old power supply wire and making a new one to fix the problem. My point is check the switch first, if it works then you can go on to the MICU.\n\nCheck switch continuity, Have replaced several switches and very few MICU units for turn signal problems. Switch continuity tests are in Alldata and Mitchell."}

Mark.\n\ncheck the cam retard.should be arount 0 +-2 degrees\n\nhave had numerous problems with distributors on these. last one set cyl 3/5 miss fires for me\n\ncheck dist. for worn drive gear\n\nif the missfire was there before the tune up and it didnt change then its most likely a macanicle problem. pulling compression should confirm that. if it started after the tune up then i would swap the plug and wire from another cylinder to see if it will change cylinders. ive gotten a few plugs that had been dropped that caused misfires after tune ups before.\n\nI had one do something like this only mine showed a miss on 4 and 6. It turned out to be the fuel pressure regulator\n\nNo one mentioned the knock sensor yet. These 5.7s do have a history with bad knock sensors. What is throwing me here is that it only shows at 70mph. Just drive 69 and no worries. Kidding, its late here. I had a bad wire do the same thing at 40mph and higher. At idle it was fine at 35 it was fine at 40 it broke down. Other than following what some of the others have said. Get back to basics, assume nothing and reexamine the fuel system, ignition system and knock sensor.\n\nI've seen these with valve problems causing your concern, but you need to check the crank sensor and reluctor ring also.\n\ndo a compression check before replacing part, if compression is good check your MAF sensor if you have any other truck changed and see if it will salve your problem .\n\nTake a good look at the crank sensor. Had one not too long ago that gave a good signal and wave form, but.... Had missfire on #4, finally pulled crank sensor and it showed signs of just barely touching the reluctor. Shimmed it out and no more miss. Not sure why only #4 would miss, but...???HTH\n\nRan into a similar problem not long ago ended up having a bad valve #4 cyclinder\n\nDo a leak down test on cylinder 4, don't bother with a compression test because they can fool you. I had the same problem on a 4.3L S-10. Verified spark, good compression, changed injectors, and cylinder 4 still missfired. I did a leak down test on cyl 4 and got 80% leakage out the exhaust.\n\nrun a compression test on 4,replace plug while its out new stuff can be bad too.\n\nUse GM upper engine cleaner on it.\n\nhi, if you can check tsb 00149c and 00149d ,the fuel injector spider wires start breaking and cause misfire codes,check the tsb's and see if they apply to your vehicle,good luck Rich\n\nif this motor has a coilon each cyl then has to be a 5.3 any how mine had a bad plug in at that very cyl.one of tiny wires was about to break\n\nSounds like sticky valve syndrome.The clearance between the valve stem and valve guide is too small. At high speed the valve will stick in the guide and the cylinder will misfire.If you remove the head and then the valve spring you can open and close the valve and rotate the valve in the guide and you will feel it stick. Sometimes you can't even close the valve. Ream out the valve guide (all guides)and put the heads back on.\n\nAnytime these misfire like this at highway speeds like you described,it's caused by the exhaust valves not sealing properly due to insufficient valve stem to guide clearance.And I have noticed that the misfire will occur during a moderate to heavy acceleration and occur when TCC applies which has caused alot of techs to misdiagnose this as a trans concern.And usually the affected cylinders are the middle 4.A GM TAC Consultant told me this was due to the middle 4 cylinders being located next to the EGR ports.Anyway the fix is to remove the heads and use a small hone to increase the valve stem to guide clearance.I have seen cases of this problem that were driven a long time before having it repaired,caused the injector nozzle to melt.There is an internal TSB regarding this issue,but I cannot access it right now because GM GlobalConnect is down for maintenance."}

I suspect either the control module has failed or perhaps there is a water intrusion issueBased on your description, I suspect a problem with the central locking control module. These are all systems controlled by that control module.The first thing I would check would be to remove any floor mat you may have on the driver\u2019s side and feel the carpet. If it\u2019s wet, you have a water intrusion issue. You should also feel the carpet in the rear as that tends to be a lower area. Usually when water is in the driver\u2019s (left) side, it gets in through the bonded windshield seal (glue) from a improperly replaced windshield. The central locking control unit is located under the carpet immediately in front of the driver\u2019s seat. The carpet must be lifted, the box housing the controller must be removed, and the controller inspected for water intrusion. I have had luck taking the controllers apart and drying them out. But if it has been awhile it may require replacement. Also check the passenger (right) side. The controller for the automatic transmission (if so equipped) is housed at the passenger\u2019s feet If water intrusion is not the issue, I suggest you interrogat the central locking control module and checking for any stored Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs). Further testing, diagnosis and repair would be based on any DTC(s) retrieved.\n\nRemove the door panel and ground terminal # 4 in the latch wire plug.It should be red/grey.Terminal #4 goes to ground through the contact switch when the door is open.If that makes the lights stay on without pulsing,then the contact switch is your problem.Also usually when the contact switch is bad you won't have footwell or puddle lights for that corner of the car.\n\nSounds like you have 2 issues here. First the door switch is probably bad as others have mentioned. Second, we have found with the scan tool hooked up while interagating 35 (central locking) the dome lights will flash. This is due to the scan tool being hooked up, it is like the abs light comes on when interagating 03 or the abs module. See if the dome lights work properly without the scan tool hooked up. This may be a ghost issue that we have incountered. Hope this work for you."}

The AF sensor reads .98-1.00 volts all of the timegoing down the road or at idle. One of our techs put in a denso sensor and said it looks like the one he took out. Now in my lap and here is what i see. MAF is at 3.1 gps at idle and only hits 117 gps on hard accell. AF sensor rarely moves from 1.00 volts at any driving instance. If I pull the brake booster hose it goes lean 1.33 v and if I add propane till it almost stalls going rich it goes to .73 v. This seems to be the very small amount of swing for one extreme to another. Any insight will be appreciated.", "output": "a/f ratio sensors work way different then regulat o2 sensor....what you are reading is ratio...1.00 equals 14.7 to 1 air to fuel ratio....there is a voltage reading that is supplied to the a/f sensor...but is the microamperage that is applied to the pump in the a/f sensor that creates air fuel ratio data inside the ecm...toyota's a/f sensor reference is 3.35volts and if that is off you have to check wiring and computer but it techical has nothing to do with o2 output...you can NOT read these sensors with a voltmeter...you have to use scan data...use short and long term trims in generic ob2 scan data...sometimes ob2 generic may do a conversion so it looks like regular o2 data you can understand\n\nHonestly, what you are showing for engine data doesn't look that unusual to me. The MAF may be a little low, depending on what RPM that 117g/s number was read at, but not horribly so. The A/F sensors on these cars will report either lambda or equivalency ratio, not actual voltage, so the previous reply is right. Check to see what the rear O2 is doing, as well as your fuel trims. Also check your freeze frame data to see when the code is setting. If it is setting on a cold engine, you'll want to smoke the intake and look for leaking intake gaskets.\n\nHi Mark,How quickly does the code set? Does it set more so at idle or cruising? Have you looked at Mode 6 data and freeze frame? Chances are there is a vacuum leak / unmetered air. Look for mis-routed hoses or split in hose. Injector O-rings could be leaking vacuum.\n\nI don't know what you are using for a scanner but, if you can, graph long and short term fuel trims, upstream and downstream O2/AF sensors, MAF and lamda/equivalency ratio.Then find a clear spot of road and floor it from a stop and hold it through its first shift point. Your O2s should peg rich (.9 v) and stay there and you will get a better idea of your true GPS from the MAF (120 or better is good). If you have less than .9V from your O2's you have a fuel delivery issue (line restriction, inadequate volume, clogged injectors). Fuel pressure only tells part of the story. Good Luck!!WC\n\nDo a volumetric efficiency test. Make sure your not having a clogged exhaust. Use a vacuum gauge to check your vacuum vs map readings. Do a back pressure test.\n\nI would start with the freeze-frame data to determine under what conditions the P0171 is setting. Hot vs. cold; idle/cruise vs. under load.See if your scanner has a PID for the A/F sensor milliamps. This is how you tell what this type sensor is doing. Then repeat your leaning out/enrichening to see how the sensor responds.During the on-road load test that has already been suggested, graph the fuel trims and load PID along with the MAF PID and A/F sensor milliamps and the voltage output from the rear O2 sensor.\n\nWhat you are monitoring on the AFR is lambda, not voltage. Go into generic OBD data, select only SHORT TERM TRIM, LONG TERM TRIM, AFR VOLTAGE, and REAR O2 VOLTAGE. If your trims are high at idle but normal at 2500, you likely have a vacuum leak. If trims are normal at idle, or erratic, perform the lean and rich test again while displaying the PIDs I mentioned. You should see the voltages for AFR and O2 respond dramatically under each condition. It is very common for one of the two to lose recognition of either lean or rich conditions.\n\nAlso, immediately replace any aftermarket parts with dealer OEM parts. If the customer does not approve, give the vehicle back to them and cut your losses.\n\nNot to sounds like I'm doubting anything, but if you have a Subaru with a weird fuel trim issue in the future, know that most Subarus from the early 2000 use the rear O2 sensor as a final fuel feedback control. I know from personal experience on my own 06 Legacy that if the rear has an \"in range\" fault, it will drive the car down the freeway at 12:1 air/fuel ratio continuously. It trusts the rear O2 over the front AFR sensor as long as it has an \"in range\" fault. The ECM would interpret this as a \"lean\" condition and may potentially set lean codes although it is running pig rich.\n\nWell, at cruise, with the car in TCC lock-up, the RPM range would be pretty low, which means not a lot of throttle opening. So, a change in grams/sec. without a corresponding change in throttle opening, would lean out the engine.Remember that codes only set when the performance falls out of the range by a significant amount...glad you got it."}

May have had a good pedal before you cleaned and lubed the slides and got calipers returning properly.\n\nMany times a caliper to brake pad shim will not be allowing a full advancement of the caliper piston, effectivly the disc brakes are \"out of adjustment\", It does not need alot of clearance between the pad and piston to create a low pedal when this occurs, What I do to eliminate this aspect is to lightly clamp off each brake line (all four, or three when only one flex line goes to the rear brakes) and stomp on the pedal. if it is high and hard than I release one clamp at a time to see what wheel causes the pedal to drop the most. But do check the pad to caliper to bracket and make sure that a shim or clip is not stopping the pad and piston to remain in a fully contacted position. Also I recall one time when I first started out I could not get a brake pedal for all wishes... turns out I had the calipers on the opposite wheels and the bleed screws ended up below the brake line entrance heights... Bleeder screw must be at highest point on the caliper when installed.. simple oversight causes so much grief... Good Luck\n\nI had the same problem on a Mazda miata.

This often happens when the brake fluid goes for years [6+] without being flushed out. A black sludge builds up inside the brake system parts. It will often get stirred up in the master cylinder when you pump the pedal to the floor. The pistons are now traveling in an area that they have not covered in many years. That breaks that sludge free. You have two choices. Flush 2+ quarts of new fluid through the system to try to get the sludge out of the master cylinder OR just replace the master cylinder.\n\nI know this sounds stupid but make sure the bleeder is on top on the caliper you replaced or it won't bleed. I have seen this before, unbelievable but true."}

Using a Gates timing belt kit, dealer water pump, and dealer hydraulic timing belt tensioner. After installation of these items and checking to make sure that the tensioner's pushrod extension was within limits, the tensioner bleeds down after 45 minutes. This naturally causes the slack side of the belt to become loose. If you rotate the crank less than half a turn the tensioner rod extends and takes up the slack. My question is is this normal for a hydraulic tensioner to bleed down when the crankshaft isn't turning? Thanks for your help.", "output": "No that is not normal, you have a defective tensioner.\n\nNo it's not. What you'll have to do is set the preload on the timing belt by adjusting the tensioner pulley. There are two holes in the pulley; turn the pulley until slight tension (about 25-30 ft/lb of torque) is applied to the belt. When you spin it over the pushrod should not extend more than 1/8\". You can use needle nose pliers to adjust the pulley.\n\nSeveral things for you to be aware of while doing this job. The reluctor plate on the cambelt drive gear always falls off of the 2 roll pins on the back of the gear.Always remove the gear, inspect the reluctor plate to see if it's bent, check the crankshaft sensor for cracks, and make sure the metal ring is also put back on the roll pins with the concave side facing the crankshaft. Next the tensioner pulley has 2 \"snake eyes\" which on this model I believe mount downward. to adjust the tensioner pulley all you need to do is move the tensioner pulley inward until the grenade pin in the hydraulic unit has no drag when moving it in and out. Once set pull the pin and rotate the motor to #1 TDC making sure you only turn the crankshaft clockwise while looking at it from the front. Make sure the pin still will slide in and out of the hydraulic tensioner freely and if the timing marks all line up you're good to go.\n\nNo it is not... Tensioner is defective.\n\nNo, this is no normak condition. Did you ajust the tensioner pulley?\n\nJon, It shouldn't bleed down and should keep tension on belt at all times.\n\nDaniel is right. Move the tensioner pulley with the two holes so the belt is tight. When you pull the pin on the tensioner the belt and or pin should barely come out or move at all. If the pin comes out far on the tensioner then the pulley would have to be re-adjusted.\n\nthe gates component kit should have had good detailed instructions on this install, you have to set your tension first by rotating the ecentric tensioner pulley, when your tension on this pulley is correct and you have rotated the engine two times over you should be able to pull the pin on the hydraulic tensioner and feel very little resistance. the two small holes in the tensioner pulley can be turned with 45 degree snap ring pliers if you don't have the special spanner wrench.\n\nHi JonAdam and Daniel are correct, read the repair info, which came with the kit!! Also all data is good too."}

Both sides need to be set up because the belt gear can be on but the cams can be out of sync.

Harold Rising Sun Automotive\n\ntony send me your fax number or email address and i will send you the timing mark details from our australian book.\n\nThe belt timing is easy, the timing of the cam's is where it gets tricky. Once the marks are lined up on the cams and the belt is timed it takes several revolutions to line the marks up on the cams again. I think that if you've timed it incorrectly there may be some more bent valves again. Dan\n\ncheck keyway on crankshaft timmming gear to see if it has moved. I have seen this happen on lower milage vehicles.sometimes the crank will be wore beyond repair.\n\nYou probably have bent valves again.This is a weird design,it has a driver off of the camgear that planetary gears the actual cams.Take time when turning everything into place,if you havent bent valves already,it will.Alldata has a decent explanation of how to set gears.HTH\n\nhi tony. i can tell you that these things have several different marks. i would look at the marks for a different tear, and perhaps a honda passport. the genieous's at isuzu decided it would be cost effective to make one cover with several marks on it.i don't think they are interference engines. so i would find another mark setup that differs from the one you have already tried, and see what happens. good luck, rick\n\ni don't know how valves could possibly bend, it's a non-interferance engine. isuzu has issued a service bulletin with very specific instructions for setting the belt timing, it would take me an hour to type it out here. also, don't forget all 4 cam gears are 2-piece and need to be preloaded properly or you will have loud rattling noises.\n\nTony, 98 and newer 3.2 and 3.5 Isuzu V6 engines use two steps to get the 2-1 crank/cam ratio. the first step involves the belt between the crank sprocket and the cam sprocket. the cam sprocket, however, is not mounted on a cam shaft, it is mounted on a idler shaft that inturn drives both the intake and exhuast camshafts. there is a gear reduction between the idler shaft and the cams that provides the second step. when the belt breaks on these engines no valves will bend as they are free spinning. to re time them properly you need to set the cam sprocket/idler shaft as follows. using a 14mm socket on a ratchet, rotate the passenger side sprocket clockwise, it will 'snap' around. eventualy it will snap to the 12 o'clock position (perpendicular to the deck) and the mark on the sprocket will line up with the mark on the cam cover. if you repeat this process you will find it takes 9 snaps before it returns and lines up again. the drivers side needs to be snaped around until the mark on the sprocket snaps to the 9 o'clock position. then it needs to be rotated a quarter turn to 12 o'clock. the V notch on the back of the crank sprocket is lined up with the mark on the oil pump housing at the 3 o'clock position. this is TDC #2! and the belt can be installed.Tony, since you sublet the heads its possible that the cams have not been timed to the idler shafts properly. i would re time the engine as i have described above before pulling the cam cam covers as the left cover is not easy to remove. the left and right exhaust cams are the same and have two sets of marks on the gears, a single dot and a double dot. the intake cams are diferent, one has a single dot the other has a double dot. there for one bank uses the single dots to line up to the idler gear and the other bank uses the double dots to line up to to the idler gear. the cams are easily removed in car ( once that left cam cover is off) but be sure to install a 5 mm bolt through the back of the cam gears into the sub gear(anti backlash gear) before removing the cams. the sub gears are spring loaded and will rotate one tooth if the bolt is not installed first. after confirming the the dots are correctly lined up, snap the idler sprockets and install the belt. HTH\n\nmaybe a bad keyway on a gear,could cam gears be reversed?\n\nBeen there,done that!!!Get a cup of coffee(or soda ) and start reading up on this strange setup. THIS IS NOT A NORMAL SETUP!!!Each cam gear can turn three revolutions before the RIGHT position is found. The only way to tell is the position of the cams themselves . You can see one cam thru the oil fill cap but you have to remove the other valve cover to get the other side right.Sorta like the Honda with the balance shaft setup.If you have MOD or ALLDATA it is in there or they can fax ya the info. Charlie V\n\nman this is one that sucks alot.... you have to set it up from the internal gears out to the cam gears and follow the preload sequence exactly as the manual states the RH cyl head setup is critical for both head to be in time... if all dots line up correctly under valve covers and marks are correct on gears then insatll belt and crank pulley and try running it Im assuming you have a manual alldata or mitchell?? also watch out for convertor's that are plugged up.... good luck call me if you need any more advice I have been through the ringer with one of these allready....just be patient Chris O Autotrends the Z shop.....336-271-4774\n\nwow i had one come in with a cam that sheared the pin on the camshaft and the gear was off time. had no compression on the pass side head. replaced cam and it fixed it.\n\nTony, The cams have to \"spring\" into place. Right bank has to spring to 9oclock then held at 12. The left bank must \"spring\" into 12 oclock. Larry\n\nThe camshafts are driven by a gear from the cam sprocket, look up the directions on mitchel/alldata or what info you use and follow them exactly, the procedure is a little odd but it must be done by the book, also the 3.2l is a free wheeling engine. You cannot just line up the marks like most other cars.\n\nSorry Tony, i work for Firestone to... that 800# is tough\n\nthats called passing the buck not a fix>Express yourself instantly with MSN Messenger!

A slack chain allowing an intake valve to open at shut down?Another possibility is a hanging/sticky intake valve. Try disabling the fuel, use an Amp clamp and scope to check cranking compression. A problem cylinder should show up has a low Amp draw in the ripple pattern. Using a separate channel monitor one of the coil inputs to determine firing order and then you can confirm which cylinder is having an issue.In most cases a sticky valve can be found with a simple vacuum tester and watch for bouncing of the needle.\n\nNo Chevy expert, but, yes some engines have an \"air rushing\" sound when shut off, due to equalization of the pressures before and after the throttle body.Would be more noticeable if the air intake boot, any lines or baffles attached to it are torn/damaged.During testing some things, I often have the intake boot off the T-body. Pretty loud air rush for up to a second after engine stop.\n\npretty sure this is normal. If you do not have any other issues, I would not chase this.\n\nIs this a customer complaint or a worry? Does vehicle run fine other wise ?\n\nI would address any other concerns before exploring this farther, any compressed air in a cylinder could do this more so with variable cam timing than previous fixed cam timing engines. IMO HTH\n\nThis can be somewhat normal. As you shut off the engine it comes upon a compression stroke then it ignites and kicks the Piston back down which rotates the cam and allows intake valve to open allowing the pressure in the cylinder to blow into the intake. Likely would only happen sporadically. Wouldn't expect that every time it is shut off. This happened much more often on an engine with a high spark advance igniting before tdc and blowing engine backwards. Hot carbon on the cylinder can ignite and cause it. An engine decarbonization may help.\n\npossible air leak in intake\n\nI would run a top engine cleaner through it. bg sells some good products . gm top engine cleaner and let it sit overnight. then flush it with water at high rpm....\n\nMany of the 3.6 I work on do this on occasion, even low milage ones. If your MAP sensor is attached and no codes move on to the other issue.\n\ncheck air filter install. washer hoses, wires get caught under cover everyday. poor design. gl."}
{"instruction": "Answer the following question after understanding the specifics of the vehicle in question.\n\nIt is a 1997 Mercury Sable GS 3.0L Coolant. with the VIN [No VIN Available] and a mileage of 75,800 mi. This 1997 Mercury Sable GS is a 3.0L / 6 cyl / Gas engine with 4-speed Automatic Transaxle (Electronic) transmission.\nDelivery system: Fuel Injection Affected component: Coolant Conditions: Boiling Coolant", "input": "lack of heat and coolant boiling in system.", "output": "is it possible the thermostat was installed backwards? or it could be air trapped in the cooling system. sometimes you have to thermo-cycle the engine.which is run it for awhile then shut it off and let it set for a minute then run it some more and shut it down for a minute. watch the gauge and coolant level as you do this so you dont overheat it. sometimes this helps burp the trapped air out.\n\nCould all be related to air in the cooling system but could be a clogged heater core and air in the system. This is what we had to do on the early 2.8 V/6 engines where the thermostat was in the water pump. Boil some water, pour it in the top hose to open the thermostat, and fill with coolant. Burp the air by cracking a heater hose several times. Should correct the problem if it is air.\n\nRad cooling fan(s) working?...you no say....pressure building/holding...you no say...with 50-50 mix and 15 lbs pressure ya should not crack a boil until about 265*f....what about actual temperatures...you no say....get your tool man to demo an \"Air Lift\" ...vacuum fill device...make sure to prime the fill hose so you do not defeat the purpose of the tool....do a leakdown test of each cylinder and see if it displaces water with each cylinder at TDc and 175 psi shop air holding in each one(one at a time ,of course)...hthy...Dan Habluetzel....South Texas...\n\nNeed more info. How long does this take from cold start? Is it actually boiling or overpreasuring and blowing out radiator. Are fans activating normally? What does dash gauge say temp is? Are you getting all air out of system? What does PCM say temp is? Did you replace radiator cap with good 16psi cap? Ford had a recall we used to do on these for what we called chocolate milk coolant. It came from cavitation in the cooling system that produced bubbles in coolant. These allowed corrosion in water jacket that turned coolant into bad smelling brown goo. Part of the recall was to fill the system with a muriatic acid flush that disolved blockages in the water jacket. The flush for that involved pulling the block frost plugs on both sides and direct flushing the block. Only thing that will cause coolant to actually reach boiling point is lack of flow either through block or radiator, or large amount air in sytem allowing steam to build. It sounds like you have the radiator covered so I would consider the block plugged up. Also consider radiator cap. Its desiged to hold PSI until it reaches 16psi.If its not holding small amounts of air that are normal in the system turn to steam and push coolant past cap making it appear to be overheating when its not. Under normal driving conditions you have to try hard to hurt this 3.0. I have towed them in drowned, burned, and one had been driven 15 miles to get off toll road after popping its lower hose and emptying most of its coolant. This guy drove till it siezed. All we did was replace the hose, refill system and it started back up without a miss. Iv'e had these brought in with others convinced the head gaskets were bad. Most just need coolant flow restored in the block and radiator, a couple were bad caps, but I have yet to have to replace head gaskets. 3.8s are the head gasket nightmares. I can't remember the recall number we did back in late 90's but if you can find it you will see a procedure for restoring flow in the jackets. Sorry to be so long but understanding cooling systems is something I see less and less of. We are too quick to jump to wrong diagnosis without it. Am I preaching now? Sorry and good luck.\n\nA short list of things i have seen that overheat motors: thermostat installed backwards; water pump impeller broken/rotating wrong direction; heater hoses reversed; radiator fan rotating wrong direction/blade backwards; fan never coming on; sediment accumulated in bottom of cooling jacket.\n\nand a shorter list: cracked cylinder head(s); cylinder head gaskets installed incorrectly/not correct for application.\n\nHow do you know it is boiling? Does it puke out the overflow? Temp gauge or light shows overheat? Maybe system is airbound, head(s) cracked, or proble, with head gasket install. Make sure both gaskets are the same... I got bit once by crossed head gaskets on another make car, (BOSS rushed me and I failed to notice the 2 different gaskets, I installed the one for the back on the front, blocking off the port for hot coolant to reach the T-stat) Good luck, HTH, Ken\n\nsounds to me you might need to bleed the air out of the system, sometimes you can get airlocked and nothing will flow, i ran into the same thing on a 99 taurus and loosened the top hose just enough to let air out, and it was fine. if air persists in the system after bleeding it, maybe theres an issue with the head.\n\nyou may have too recheck the water pump blades\n\nBrian, did you do a compression check for blown head gasket?\n\n\"lack of heat and coolant boiling in system\"...??? Brian I would venture to guess that you are a man of few words!Not much to work with here except the list of parts. Did you do all this because of these symptoms or did this pop up after you did the work?The only clue that you provide is when you say \"lack of heat\" which I can only read to mean that the heater core is not transferring heat to the cabin? Correct? In which case, I'd agree with the folks that say you have trapped air. Worse case would be the head gasket job was botched in some way ie: wrong gaskets, installation.But, I do have another question; Did you check the radiator cap? I see plenty of guys do all the BIG stuff and forget to check the cap. I personally check even the new ones and have found them no good out of the box. I have also seen caps hold too much pressure due to being stuck from corrosion and that will not allow for de-gassing and can blow cores and gaskets if allowed to rise too high.G'luck\n\ni have seen people install a block heater or leaking soft plug and knock the old soft plug into the block and leave it in the block after time the soft plug will work its way towards the water pump and restrict flow. just an idea as i assume you have checked for head gaskets leaking. hard to diagnose may have to remove waterpump and drain block and use borescope to find, but like i said have seen it happen before. hope this helps, good luck.\n\nwhat was the original concern? sounds like cooling system is airbound. make sure the heater core is not plugged.\n\ncheck the water pump impeller. the heater cores are the low point in the system and plug up with junk. flush with garden hose both directions and watch the crap come out.\n\nHi Brian.. Read your replies.. all good.. Where to start ? ;>} \" Spill Free Funnel \" is a great tool for burping all the air out of a cooling system... Do you have a rad. pressure tester ? Should take about 3 pumps to pump this system up to 16 lbs IF it IS Full of Coolant.. ? IF you have to keep pumping on the pressure tester ? Then there is still air in the cooling system.. Quick SURE test !!.. YES, you Will need the adaptor to make either 1 of these fit this system.. This motor has been installed in FWD & RWD vehicles.. I installed a Used FWD Motor in MY RWD Aerostar & learned the Hard way That the head gaskets are NOT the Same !! IF you Still have the part numbers ? I Would check This !! the large holes for allowing the coolant to flow are at different ends of the heads depending on which vehicle this motor is installed in.. It has also been around long enough, to have been changed from the V belts to the serpitine belts..When they did this, \" They \" changed the direction of the water pump impeller.. Quick test for Most motors.. pull the heater hose at the *rear* of the motor, let it bleed down.. Crank the motor { NOT Run } IF the coolant comes OUT of the block Here ? = Correct water pump.. IF the coolant sucks Back Into the motor ? = WRONG direction Pump !! I have seen a few of these overheated.. Rad Blew & it was driven untill it would no longer drive.. Black smoke out the tailpipe.. What I found on those.. the block, where the head gasket attaches.. the 2 bolts with the alignment rings around them, had raised on the block.. So the block was Warped & there was No WAY the head gaskets would pull down & seal Again... Hope this Helps with Your Puzzle ;>? K.P.\n\nsome of these vehicles had \"the brown coolant syndrome\" where the heater core hoses were not run right for proper circulation there was a recall from ford to correct this with an updated heater core hose assly as far as i know the recall is long over but the updated hose is still available (for sale) from ford may include service procedure flush, sometimes in bad cases replacing freeze plugs,sometimes heater core even after thorough flushing,hope this helps regards jr\n\nThere are two small lines (3/8\" diameter) that run into the reservoir to bleed air from the rad and the engine. Remove these lines from the reservoir and blow some air back into them to be sure they are clear. If they are plugged it is almost impossible to bleed the air from this system. Most likely corrosion at the pipes these lines connect to. Hope this helps, good luck."}

This Saturn is driving us crazy,came to us with service soon light on and codes 19,42,48, and sometimes will crank long time before it starts and sometimes sputters and dies. No problem, we advised customer to replace the (ICM)Ignition control module and Crank sensor, customer told me the module and the ignition coils were just replaced by another shop, I told him well the Crank sensor needs to be replaced also if the module is not a good brand I like to replace the module too,we replaced the Module STANDARD LX387 RED BOX. and Crank sensor AC DELCO,tested the car two to three days no problems, the fourth day started acting up again, I removed the plugs at control moudule and reinforced the connectors also at crank sensor, we tested it for three to four days no broblems, then I removed the new ignition module installed the old one back in,tested it again, no problems,gave the car to the customer,checked on him after three days he told me things were good no problems, he calls me back the seventh day and will not start and the light is on. Brought the car to work same codes, sometimes it sputters and dies in the mornings or when gets very hot, this time I only have the code 19 not the 42 and 48. I have checked the crank signal and the 6x the signal from the module can not see any problems with the Vantage, I also checked the ignition wires they are not new but they are ok,sprayed water on them no problems,I cleaned the junk under the crank sensor mounting, I removed the oil pan and made sure no problems with the gap between crank and sensor,there is no set gap but looks ok. My question is can the computer PCM/ECM can cause a problem like this, also some of you talked about misfire cylinder #1 and #4 can cause this, the car has valve train or chain rattle inside the valve cover or front of the engine area could this be the cause? Should I remove the cover and check chain and valve train? Thanks again.", "output": "this one bring back bad memories saturn same thing you desciped intermitten on going almost a year found an alarm system customer didnot know he had stuffed under dash bad removed car ran great worth a look good luck\n\nWould put A/C Delco module. Check all grounds to PCM. And yes I would check noises. Make sure valve timing has no issues. Hth. I would change wires also, cant hurt.\n\nThere was a TSB on these vehicles for start and stall when cold.Eventually the car stopped starting.The CTS would leak into the harness,you might have to disconnect connector to see if leaking.But monitoring the CTS when cold will give you an idea if it is defective.I know you have other codes, this was just so common on this eng.New CTS and Pigtail were recommended.

People seem to easily confuse the low coolant light with the battery light on these. Just a thought. The X3 that generation didn\u2019t have battery registering as I recall.\n\nWater pump needs replaced. It interferes with alternator bsd data. They share communications line.\n\nNot only can the water pump interfere, but I believe so can the oil level sensor. There is a test plan to see the communication. If the bus is down, then it has you unplug a connector one by one until communication is restored. If that\u2019s even your problem. Your water pump likely needs replacement anyway.I would still check all the main B+ and ground connections around the engine. Check that ground strap from engine to chassis! Also, I believe all cars with N52 engine utilize the smart charging system. The way to tell what it was born with is to look in the registered replacement history under battery registration in the service functions menu. If you are using Autel, I think you click service, body, voltage supply and register battery. It says at the top. You can replace with a different battery if you want, just then have to go to programming and retrofit/conversions to change the size and type.\n\nI agree. The pump can affect charging.\n\nWhat my previous reply was supposed to say is that I agree you should address the comm code, as water-pump comm problems can affect charging.\n\nA simple code check would probably send you in the right direction. I have had issues with the oil level sensor causing coolant pump and alternator issues.\n\nCould also be the dme bsd chip known to go bad one of my more common repairs\n\nreplace the water pump and thermostat. install a agm battery.\n\nwould suspect water pump and thermostat. eng oil level sensor also are known to cause alternator issues. for information to OTHERS we had same issue that drove us crazy turned out to be bosch alternator times 2 so we put in OE alternator all was good.(did read you put oe alt.)\n\nI had an E60 recently that would show the battery light and reset the clock each time. I did have voltage faults but voltage was fine, replaced the IBS/negative battery terminal. it was sending a faulty signal. chris\n\nI would scope the bsd line. Should be a violet wire. Yes it could be all those things everyone else is taking about. Once you fine the one taking down the signal you will know what is causing the issue.
