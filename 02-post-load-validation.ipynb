       "David, the crank shaft drives an idler gear, one per head, via the timing belt. each idler gear then drives 2 camshafts for the final 2-1 crank-cam ratio. for a straight forward belt replacement, the crank is turned until the marks on the crank sprocket and the marks on the idler gears line up to there corresponding marks. if how ever the idler gears are rotated independently of the crank then it will no longer be timed properly.reset it as follows. turn the crank sprocket so that the V notch at the rear of the sprocket is at 3 o'clock and it lines up with a mark on the oil pump cover. using a 14mm socket on a ratchet turn the right bank (passenger side) idler sprocket clockwise ( this is a free spinning engine and will not bend valves). the sprocket will snap around. keep turning it until the line( usually painted green) on the sprocket snaps to the 12 o'clock position and lines up with the mark on the cam cover. (it should take less than 9 snaps and then it will repeat.) turn the left bank idler sprocket until its line snaps to the 9 o'clock position ( parallel to the deck of the block). you may want to repeat this a second time just to prove to your self that it is stopping at the right spot. once the line on the sprocket has snapped to the 9 o'clock position, turn it 1/4 turn up to the 12 o'clock position. install the belt. if you are using an OEM belt it will have 2 lines and a set of dots. the dots go down at the crank sprocket at the 9 o'clock position where the is a green mark on the front edge of the sprocket. the lines on the belt will then line up with the mark on the idler sprockets at 12 o'clock.

A good majority of the valves were bent, requiring replacement of both heads(customer choice). Also a belt, tensionor and idler kit with all pulleys, water pump were replaced. All parts came from saab. Post repair vehicle conditions are as follows: the vehicle will shake at idle, and vibrates the entire vehicle. The frequency of the shake is very high. This is not a \"dead miss\" feel or a lope, but a fast vibration. Also, when coming of of idle, at approx 1500 rpm, you can hear a chattering noise that is very loud. I pulled the serpentine belt off to eliminate possible accessory drive noise, and pulled the timing cover with hopes that possibly tension was relieved causing mistiming and also belt chatter. THe belt was 1 tooth off, so I retimed the system, and retested with front cover off- all systems still there. I did notice that on rev up- the timing belt appears to loosen and twist slightly between the crank and the tensionor roller. the slapping appears to increase along with the noise, and i am confident that it is the source of the noise. I increased tension on the belt, exceeding the manufacturers spec- with no positive results. I then peformed a compresion test with thoughts that maybe the shaking was due to a valve not seating all the way. Compresion test results did not indicate this theory. I also ran a oil pressure test, because i know that a plugged suction tube in the oil pan can cause oil starvation on accel- results indicate screen is clear.

Do not use this procedure as a substitute for a 10-minute relearn when replacing or reprogramming a theft deterrent module (TDM) or engine control module (ECM). Doing so will result in a failure to learn the pre-release password and/or the challenge/response data.This 10-minute learn procedure should be used when all vehicle keys are desired to be replaced or reprogrammed. This procedure will erase all previously learned vehicle keys from the TDM. Once the 10-minute learn procedure has been completed, any remaining vehicle keys may be programmed using the Adding Keys procedure to ensure their continued functionality. 1. Connect a scan tool to the vehicle in the pass-thru arrangement. 2. Turn ON the ignition, with the engine OFF. 3. Ensure that all power consuming devices are turned OFF on the vehicle. 4. On the Techline Terminal, select Service Programming System and follow the Techline Terminal on-screen instructions, using the Pass-Thru method. Ensure the correct programming selection is chosen based on component being replaced or programmed. For this procedure, go to the V.T.D. Vehicle Theft Deterrent Learn menu and choose the Vehicle Theft Deterrent Learn for Learning Replacement Keys selection. 5. At this point the scan tool must remain connected for the duration of the 10-minute relearn procedure. Important: * The scan tool will initially display 12 Minutes. The first 2 minutes allow the scan tool to initialize the appropriate control module. The remaining 10 minutes is the relearn timer. * On some vehicles the security indicator may be illuminated for the duration of the 10-minute relearn procedure. 6. Observe the scan tool, after approximately 10 minutes the scan tool will display \"Programming Successful, Turn OFF Ignition\". The vehicle is now ready to relearn the key information and/or the passwords on the next ignition switch transition from OFF to CRANK. 7. Turn OFF the ignition and wait 2 minutes. 8. With a master vehicle key, turn the ignition to the RUN position for 15 seconds, then start the vehicle. The TDM has now learned the key transponder information. 9. With a scan tool, clear any DTCs.30-Minute Vehicle Key RelearnImportant: This procedure will only relearn the vehicle keys.

Once the 30-minute learn procedure has been completed, any remaining vehicle keys may be programmed using the Adding Keys procedure to ensure their continued functionality. 1. With an unlearned master vehicle key, turn ON the ignition, with the engine OFF. 2. Observe the security indicator, after approximately 10 minutes the telltale will turn off. 3. Turn OFF the ignition, and wait 5 seconds. 4. Repeat steps 1-3 two more times for a total of 3 cycles or 30 minutes. Important: The TDM learns the key transponder information upon the ignition switch transition from OFF to ON. You must turn the ignition OFF before attempting to start the vehicle. 5. With a master vehicle key, start the vehicle. The vehicle has now learned the key transponder information. 6. If additional keys are required to be learned, refer to Adding Keys ( See: Antitheft and Alarm Systems > Procedures > Adding Keys) . 7. With a scan tool, clear any DTCs.\n",

Make sure if it has an aftermarket radio, that the wiring is correct/ Most people usually connect the factory green wire to ground and it is not. It tests ground with the key off , but when it the headlights/parklights are turned on it becomes a power for the factory radio, so it will auto dim.\n\nI hate to say this to anyone but that was an amateurish method of diagnosing a short. You probably caused a ton of problems. I would check the bulbs to see if someone put the wrong bulb in the wrong socket first. I would also ask the customer if the car was ever in an accident even if several years ago. i did have this happen once before which turned out to be a crappy install of an aftermarket radio by Longo Toyota in CA when I lived there but on a Sienna I haven't seen it. It is possible if the radio is aftermarket that they did a crappy install as well and it is shorting. Do yourself a favor and invest in a decent DVOM with an amp shunt.

My manual shows each camshaft keyway facing upward and outwards toward marks on the engine or rear cover. the crank keyway points towards the right, there should be a divot out of the plate behind the gear-this lines up with the mark on the oil pump. the line marked on the actual GEAR is where you line up the line on the belt(the line should be facing to the left). If you have the old belt, count and make sure it has the same # of teeth. If so, install it( the marks on the belt are there for aid in installation). The marks may or may not line up after rotation, the important part is the marks on the engine line up afterwards. this engine turns clockwise. GOOD LUCK.\n\nEach cam sprocket is actually driving two gears on the cam. Two rotations of the crank will not make it all line up. You will have to turn it more than two rotations to get it all lined back up. If you line the cams up according to the service manual and align the marks on the timing belt #2 cylinder will be on TDC. There should be white marks on the belt and they will line up with the crank sprocket mark and cam sprocket marks. I dont remember how many turns it takes to have it all line up again but dont worry so much about that....just make sure it turns freely so as to not damage the engine.\n\nwhile you CAN use the referance points on the belt, it may take quite a few turns for them to line up again.

(it should take less than 9 snaps and then it will repeat.) turn the left bank idler sprocket until its line snaps to the 9 o'clock position ( parallel to the deck of the block). you may want to repeat this a second time just to prove to your self that it is stopping at the right spot. once the line on the sprocket has snapped to the 9 o'clock position, turn it 1/4 turn up to the 12 o'clock position. install the belt. if you are using an OEM belt it will have 2 lines and a set of dots. the dots go down at the crank sprocket at the 9 o'clock position where the is a green mark on the front edge of the sprocket. the lines on the belt will then line up with the mark on the idler sprockets at 12 o'clock.

Also a belt, tensionor and idler kit with all pulleys, water pump were replaced. All parts came from saab. Post repair vehicle conditions are as follows: the vehicle will shake at idle, and vibrates the entire vehicle. The frequency of the shake is very high. This is not a \"dead miss\" feel or a lope, but a fast vibration. Also, when coming of of idle, at approx 1500 rpm, you can hear a chattering noise that is very loud. I pulled the serpentine belt off to eliminate possible accessory drive noise, and pulled the timing cover with hopes that possibly tension was relieved causing mistiming and also belt chatter. THe belt was 1 tooth off, so I retimed the system, and retested with front cover off- all systems still there. I did notice that on rev up- the timing belt appears to loosen and twist slightly between the crank and the tensionor roller. the slapping appears to increase along with the noise, and i am confident that it is the source of the noise. I increased tension on the belt, exceeding the manufacturers spec- with no positive results. I then peformed a compresion test with thoughts that maybe the shaking was due to a valve not seating all the way. Compresion test results did not indicate this theory. I also ran a oil pressure test, because i know that a plugged suction tube in the oil pan can cause oil starvation on accel- results indicate screen is clear.

It is very difficult to get right without it. Also, there is a procedure that is very specific for installing, timing and tensioning this belt.

I hope this helps. Bruce\n\nSounds like a conecting rod got bent when belt failed?\n\nPossibly a bent connecting rod. These are real bears to time and tension properly but you said you ovetensioned the belt so that should have eliminated belt slap. I know that these motors run a very close tolerence on piston to valve clearance. Did you get the heads from the dealer or aftermarket?. When you roll the engine over by hand with the plugs out is it smooth or can you feel any thing interfere? Good Luck\n\nIt would be very nice to know what your intake manifold vacuum looks like on this car. Where did the heads come from? The valve guides often crack when the valves get bent, and this could slow the closing of a valve."

Bruce-------------------------------------------\n\nItzhak, It is usually brake fluid that is found in that connector, and the control units fail alot, usually setting a false code for the right rear speed sensor. Was a brake job done or a brake fluid flush lately? When you order a control unit you will need to know if the car has trax[ there will be a trax light and control switch on console if it does. Good Luck Dave\n\nHi the usual fault we find with the ABS control module is an internal solder joint problem causing a rear wheel sensor code. I have never seen a failure due to corrision. Are you in a flood location? Does the customer remember the car being under water. There is a repair kit available for the connector and you should be able to get the terminals separately ,good luck doing the job. George.\n\nDon't know of any problem shorts on this unit,but the connector is kind of tricky to unhook and we see many of these broken by previous attempts to unhook. I use a plastic zip-tie (or what ever you wish to call them) to keep the connector held together good. It's possible this one was not secured well, allowing water in or allowing poor connections and arcing. Hope this helps,\n\nSay I don`t know if it will help, but I have a friend who specialize in Saab`s and Volvos, maybe he can get the connector for you , or he has a spare. His phone number is 562-434-5113. his name is Russell and tell him In recommended you to call him. you might have to pay for shipping.turn this email off from the links at the bottom of this message.This fix received (6) replies:READ the Replies: http://members.ia...t/tr?a=e0011161744br RATE this Fix: http://members.ia...t/rf?a=e0011161744br UPGRADE: http://members.iatn.net/upgrade/1996 Volvo 850Engine: 2.4 L / 5 cyl / Gas / DOHC Fuel: Fuel Injection Ignition: Distributor-Breakerless Trans: 4-speed Automatic Transaxle (Electronic) Mileage: 150,000 mi VIN: YV1LW5543TMisc Data: NON TURBO WAGON Affected Item: ABS MODULE CONNECTOR Condition: BURNT AND CORRODED CONNECTORCLOSED W/SUMMARY Thanks to the replies, the custmer called Volvo which at first said this was covered under the Bulletin (see replies above), but then Volvo called him back and said the vehicle is NOT covered.

HTH\n\nI have had trouble relearning keys myself...here's what 'some'-data has to offer, hope it helps:Replacing Keys (North America except Canada)10-Minute Vehicle Key RelearnImportant: This procedure will only relearn the vehicle keys. This procedure will not learn the immobilizer prerelease password or the challenge/response data. Do not use this procedure as a substitute for a 10-minute relearn when replacing or reprogramming a theft deterrent module (TDM) or engine control module (ECM). Doing so will result in a failure to learn the pre-release password and/or the challenge/response data.This 10-minute learn procedure should be used when all vehicle keys are desired to be replaced or reprogrammed. This procedure will erase all previously learned vehicle keys from the TDM. Once the 10-minute learn procedure has been completed, any remaining vehicle keys may be programmed using the Adding Keys procedure to ensure their continued functionality. 1. Connect a scan tool to the vehicle in the pass-thru arrangement. 2. Turn ON the ignition, with the engine OFF. 3. Ensure that all power consuming devices are turned OFF on the vehicle. 4. On the Techline Terminal, select Service Programming System and follow the Techline Terminal on-screen instructions, using the Pass-Thru method. Ensure the correct programming selection is chosen based on component being replaced or programmed. For this procedure, go to the V.T.D. Vehicle Theft Deterrent Learn menu and choose the Vehicle Theft Deterrent Learn for Learning Replacement Keys selection. 5. At this point the scan tool must remain connected for the duration of the 10-minute relearn procedure. Important: * The scan tool will initially display 12 Minutes. The first 2 minutes allow the scan tool to initialize the appropriate control module. The remaining 10 minutes is the relearn timer. * On some vehicles the security indicator may be illuminated for the duration of the 10-minute relearn procedure. 6. Observe the scan tool, after approximately 10 minutes the scan tool will display \"Programming Successful, Turn OFF Ignition\". The vehicle is now ready to relearn the key information and/or the passwords on the next ignition switch transition from OFF to CRANK. 7. Turn OFF the ignition and wait 2 minutes. 8. With a master vehicle key, turn the ignition to the RUN position for 15 seconds, then start the vehicle. The TDM has now learned the key transponder information. 9. With a scan tool, clear any DTCs.30-Minute Vehicle Key RelearnImportant: This procedure will only relearn the vehicle keys.

Doing so will result in a failure to learn the prerelease password and/or the challenge/response data.This 30-minute learn procedure should be used when all vehicle keys are desired to be replaced or reprogrammed. This procedure will erase all previously learned vehicle keys from the TDM. Once the 30-minute learn procedure has been completed, any remaining vehicle keys may be programmed using the Adding Keys procedure to ensure their continued functionality. 1. With an unlearned master vehicle key, turn ON the ignition, with the engine OFF. 2. Observe the security indicator, after approximately 10 minutes the telltale will turn off. 3. Turn OFF the ignition, and wait 5 seconds. 4. Repeat steps 1-3 two more times for a total of 3 cycles or 30 minutes. Important: The TDM learns the key transponder information upon the ignition switch transition from OFF to ON. You must turn the ignition OFF before attempting to start the vehicle. 5. With a master vehicle key, start the vehicle. The vehicle has now learned the key transponder information. 6. If additional keys are required to be learned, refer to Adding Keys ( See: Antitheft and Alarm Systems > Procedures > Adding Keys) . 7. With a scan tool, clear any DTCs.\n\nThere should be a separate programming procedure to learn the theft module to the ECM. It may not work with a used module, you may need a new module and keys."

The oil pressure is much higher than the water pressure.\n\nwe just did a head gasket on a 1995 960, same problem. we found the head gasket was blown, the rear head bolt on the exh side was broken. we were able to extract the bolt no problem.

Sounds like it has a hole in a boost hose or other large intake leak. 171 and 300 together with your stall is pretty typical behavior for a car with a hole in an intercooler hose. Could be a brake booster or the pipe to it leaking but it takes a big air/vacuum leak to set the misfire code too.Justin\n\nARE YOU sure there are no other codes? the throttle on these is kinda funky- it has a special procedure to reset the the cable so as to put it into computer controll- can be viewed on you-tube\n\nPull on throttle cable and see if the shiny metal arm is moving as well. If it does, the throttle is in limp home mode and you have to reset that following strict procedures.You can use Google search for a lot of trouble shooting nowadays.Is the air mass meter mounted in right air flow direction?\n\nTry cleaning the throttle body. Sometimes when the system is reset it goes back to original settings and if the throttle body is dirty it closes to far to run correctly. you might want to also look at your actual and desired idle readings to see if they match up. it's possible the idle control is just no reacting fast enough.\n\nthink you still have a leak at the hooter valve(BPC). see if it holds vacuum and pressure this will cause the stall after sudden decel. radio does not have a code, married and divorced to vehicle, something else is amiss there\n\nCould be electric throttle issue, but lean mix and stalling coming to a stop could, also, be a leaky brake booster or a bad turbo bypass valve.

My manual shows each camshaft keyway facing upward and outwards toward marks on the engine or rear cover. the crank keyway points towards the right, there should be a divot out of the plate behind the gear-this lines up with the mark on the oil pump. the line marked on the actual GEAR is where you line up the line on the belt(the line should be facing to the left). If you have the old belt, count and make sure it has the same # of teeth. If so, install it( the marks on the belt are there for aid in installation). The marks may or may not line up after rotation, the important part is the marks on the engine line up afterwards. this engine turns clockwise. GOOD LUCK.\n",

You will have to turn it more than two rotations to get it all lined back up. If you line the cams up according to the service manual and align the marks on the timing belt #2 cylinder will be on TDC. There should be white marks on the belt and they will line up with the crank sprocket mark and cam sprocket marks.

       "David, the crank shaft drives an idler gear, one per head, via the timing belt. each idler gear then drives 2 camshafts for the final 2-1 crank-cam ratio. for a straight forward belt replacement, the crank is turned until the marks on the crank sprocket and the marks on the idler gears line up to there corresponding marks. if how ever the idler gears are rotated independently of the crank then it will no longer be timed properly.reset it as follows. turn the crank sprocket so that the V notch at the rear of the sprocket is at 3 o'clock and it lines up with a mark on the oil pump cover. using a 14mm socket on a ratchet turn the right bank (passenger side) idler sprocket clockwise ( this is a free spinning engine and will not bend valves). the sprocket will snap around. keep turning it until the line( usually painted green) on the sprocket snaps to the 12 o'clock position and lines up with the mark on the cam cover. (it should take less than 9 snaps and then it will repeat.) turn the left bank idler sprocket until its line snaps to the 9 o'clock position ( parallel to the deck of the block). you may want to repeat this a second time just to prove to your self that it is stopping at the right spot. once the line on the sprocket has snapped to the 9 o'clock position, turn it 1/4 turn up to the 12 o'clock position. install the belt. if you are using an OEM belt it will have 2 lines and a set of dots. the dots go down at the crank sprocket at the 9 o'clock position where the is a green mark on the front edge of the sprocket. the lines on the belt will then line up with the mark on the idler sprockets at 12 o'clock.

A good majority of the valves were bent, requiring replacement of both heads(customer choice). Also a belt, tensionor and idler kit with all pulleys, water pump were replaced. All parts came from saab. Post repair vehicle conditions are as follows: the vehicle will shake at idle, and vibrates the entire vehicle. The frequency of the shake is very high. This is not a \"dead miss\" feel or a lope, but a fast vibration. Also, when coming of of idle, at approx 1500 rpm, you can hear a chattering noise that is very loud. I pulled the serpentine belt off to eliminate possible accessory drive noise, and pulled the timing cover with hopes that possibly tension was relieved causing mistiming and also belt chatter. THe belt was 1 tooth off, so I retimed the system, and retested with front cover off- all systems still there. I did notice that on rev up- the timing belt appears to loosen and twist slightly between the crank and the tensionor roller. the slapping appears to increase along with the noise, and i am confident that it is the source of the noise. I increased tension on the belt, exceeding the manufacturers spec- with no positive results. I then peformed a compresion test with thoughts that maybe the shaking was due to a valve not seating all the way. Compresion test results did not indicate this theory. I also ran a oil pressure test, because i know that a plugged suction tube in the oil pan can cause oil starvation on accel- results indicate screen is clear.

If you have the old belt, count and make sure it has the same # of teeth. If so, install it( the marks on the belt are there for aid in installation). The marks may or may not line up after rotation, the important part is the marks on the engine line up afterwards. this engine turns clockwise. GOOD LUCK.\n\nEach cam sprocket is actually driving two gears on the cam. Two rotations of the crank will not make it all line up. You will have to turn it more than two rotations to get it all lined back up. If you line the cams up according to the service manual and align the marks on the timing belt #2 cylinder will be on TDC. There should be white marks on the belt and they will line up with the crank sprocket mark and cam sprocket marks.

(it should take less than 9 snaps and then it will repeat.) turn the left bank idler sprocket until its line snaps to the 9 o'clock position ( parallel to the deck of the block). you may want to repeat this a second time just to prove to your self that it is stopping at the right spot. once the line on the sprocket has snapped to the 9 o'clock position, turn it 1/4 turn up to the 12 o'clock position. install the belt. if you are using an OEM belt it will have 2 lines and a set of dots. the dots go down at the crank sprocket at the 9 o'clock position where the is a green mark on the front edge of the sprocket. the lines on the belt will then line up with the mark on the idler sprockets at 12 o'clock.

Also a belt, tensionor and idler kit with all pulleys, water pump were replaced. All parts came from saab. Post repair vehicle conditions are as follows: the vehicle will shake at idle, and vibrates the entire vehicle. The frequency of the shake is very high. This is not a \"dead miss\" feel or a lope, but a fast vibration. Also, when coming of of idle, at approx 1500 rpm, you can hear a chattering noise that is very loud. I pulled the serpentine belt off to eliminate possible accessory drive noise, and pulled the timing cover with hopes that possibly tension was relieved causing mistiming and also belt chatter. THe belt was 1 tooth off, so I retimed the system, and retested with front cover off- all systems still there. I did notice that on rev up- the timing belt appears to loosen and twist slightly between the crank and the tensionor roller. the slapping appears to increase along with the noise, and i am confident that it is the source of the noise. I increased tension on the belt, exceeding the manufacturers spec- with no positive results. I then peformed a compresion test with thoughts that maybe the shaking was due to a valve not seating all the way. Compresion test results did not indicate this theory. I also ran a oil pressure test, because i know that a plugged suction tube in the oil pan can cause oil starvation on accel- results indicate screen is clear. So here I am, pulling out my last hair, and hoping to find the answer...HELP!!!",

I can send you the Campaign 96 and SB59 info if you send me a different e-mail address. It is in PDF format. Iatn will not accept attachments. Bruce-------------------------------------------\n\nItzhak, It is usually brake fluid that is found in that connector, and the control units fail alot, usually setting a false code for the right rear speed sensor. Was a brake job done or a brake fluid flush lately? When you order a control unit you will need to know if the car has trax[ there will be a trax light and control switch on console if it does. Good Luck Dave\n\nHi the usual fault we find with the ABS control module is an internal solder joint problem causing a rear wheel sensor code. I have never seen a failure due to corrision. Are you in a flood location? Does the customer remember the car being under water. There is a repair kit available for the connector and you should be able to get the terminals separately ,good luck doing the job. George.\n\nDon't know of any problem shorts on this unit,but the connector is kind of tricky to unhook and we see many of these broken by previous attempts to unhook. I use a plastic zip-tie (or what ever you wish to call them) to keep the connector held together good. It's possible this one was not secured well, allowing water in or allowing poor connections and arcing. Hope this helps,\n\nSay I don`t know if it will help, but I have a friend who specialize in Saab`s and Volvos, maybe he can get the connector for you , or he has a spare.

This procedure will not learn the immobilizer prerelease password or the challenge/response data. Do not use this procedure as a substitute for a 10-minute relearn when replacing or reprogramming a theft deterrent module (TDM) or engine control module (ECM). Doing so will result in a failure to learn the pre-release password and/or the challenge/response data.This 10-minute learn procedure should be used when all vehicle keys are desired to be replaced or reprogrammed. This procedure will erase all previously learned vehicle keys from the TDM. Once the 10-minute learn procedure has been completed, any remaining vehicle keys may be programmed using the Adding Keys procedure to ensure their continued functionality. 1. Connect a scan tool to the vehicle in the pass-thru arrangement. 2. Turn ON the ignition, with the engine OFF. 3. Ensure that all power consuming devices are turned OFF on the vehicle. 4. On the Techline Terminal, select Service Programming System and follow the Techline Terminal on-screen instructions, using the Pass-Thru method. Ensure the correct programming selection is chosen based on component being replaced or programmed. For this procedure, go to the V.T.D. Vehicle Theft Deterrent Learn menu and choose the Vehicle Theft Deterrent Learn for Learning Replacement Keys selection. 5. At this point the scan tool must remain connected for the duration of the 10-minute relearn procedure. Important: * The scan tool will initially display 12 Minutes. The first 2 minutes allow the scan tool to initialize the appropriate control module. The remaining 10 minutes is the relearn timer. * On some vehicles the security indicator may be illuminated for the duration of the 10-minute relearn procedure. 6. Observe the scan tool, after approximately 10 minutes the scan tool will display \"Programming Successful, Turn OFF Ignition\". The vehicle is now ready to relearn the key information and/or the passwords on the next ignition switch transition from OFF to CRANK. 7. Turn OFF the ignition and wait 2 minutes. 8. With a master vehicle key, turn the ignition to the RUN position for 15 seconds, then start the vehicle. The TDM has now learned the key transponder information. 9. With a scan tool, clear any DTCs.30-Minute Vehicle Key RelearnImportant: This procedure will only relearn the vehicle keys.

Doing so will result in a failure to learn the prerelease password and/or the challenge/response data.This 30-minute learn procedure should be used when all vehicle keys are desired to be replaced or reprogrammed. This procedure will erase all previously learned vehicle keys from the TDM. Once the 30-minute learn procedure has been completed, any remaining vehicle keys may be programmed using the Adding Keys procedure to ensure their continued functionality. 1. With an unlearned master vehicle key, turn ON the ignition, with the engine OFF. 2. Observe the security indicator, after approximately 10 minutes the telltale will turn off. 3. Turn OFF the ignition, and wait 5 seconds. 4. Repeat steps 1-3 two more times for a total of 3 cycles or 30 minutes. Important: The TDM learns the key transponder information upon the ignition switch transition from OFF to ON. You must turn the ignition OFF before attempting to start the vehicle. 5. With a master vehicle key, start the vehicle. The vehicle has now learned the key transponder information. 6. If additional keys are required to be learned, refer to Adding Keys ( See: Antitheft and Alarm Systems > Procedures > Adding Keys) . 7. With a scan tool, clear any DTCs.\n\nThere should be a separate programming procedure to learn the theft module to the ECM. It may not work with a used module, you may need a new module and keys.",

Sounds like it has a hole in a boost hose or other large intake leak. 171 and 300 together with your stall is pretty typical behavior for a car with a hole in an intercooler hose. Could be a brake booster or the pipe to it leaking but it takes a big air/vacuum leak to set the misfire code too.Justin\n\nARE YOU sure there are no other codes? the throttle on these is kinda funky- it has a special procedure to reset the the cable so as to put it into computer controll- can be viewed on you-tube\n\nPull on throttle cable and see if the shiny metal arm is moving as well. If it does, the throttle is in limp home mode and you have to reset that following strict procedures.You can use Google search for a lot of trouble shooting nowadays.Is the air mass meter mounted in right air flow direction?\n\nTry cleaning the throttle body. Sometimes when the system is reset it goes back to original settings and if the throttle body is dirty it closes to far to run correctly. you might want to also look at your actual and desired idle readings to see if they match up. it's possible the idle control is just no reacting fast enough.\n\nthink you still have a leak at the hooter valve(BPC). see if it holds vacuum and pressure this will cause the stall after sudden decel. radio does not have a code, married and divorced to vehicle, something else is amiss there\n\nCould be electric throttle issue, but lean mix and stalling coming to a stop could, also, be a leaky brake booster or a bad turbo bypass valve.

All pcm's have the program in them for theft alarm but they are suppose to only look for SAM if there is an alarm on the car. There are a lot of Pcm's that don't have the alarm looking for SAM. When this happens the pcm does not see SAM on the buss and shuts down the injectors. You'll need a new pcm or even a reman unit. After the pcm is replaced and the car has theft alarm you. Get in touch with me if you need a legal divorce from SAM. can get a legal divorce and the pcm will never look for sam, again. If you don't have theft alarm you are now fixed.

Now lock the door and then unlock the door. Try and see if it will run now. If it does you are done.If not try the lock and unlock at the passangers door. See if it starts now. The factory security system is the type that requires a signal to run. When the signal does not show at the computer it will start and die out. The switch to turn it on and off are in the doors. Also, if the batter goes blat or is disconnected it comes back on in the on position. Locking and unlocking the doors clears this and will let it run. By the way. A used computer from the salvage yard may be just fine but not work in the car due to the fact that the previous vehicles system may not have had or did have a security system. Hope this helps.

       "Hi Howard- Here's the deal. This car is activating the VTSS (Vehicle Theft Security System). Now you're probably saying to your self \"this vehicle is not equipped with VTSS.\" and you are correct! These Chrysler vehicles use 3 computers linked together by a 2 wire bus system so they can talk to each other and share common information that one computer might need from the other. It has PCM (engine), TCM (transmission) & BCM (body control) modules. In an effort to reduce the number of individually unique control modules that they would have to produce for different option packages, Chrysler decided to load ALL of the available options into their computers. This means that every vehicle has the capability of having cruise control, VTSS, A/C, Delay Wipers, etc... These option remain \"dormant\" if the vehicle doesn't have the controls to turn it on. Example: Cruise control is built into the computer(s) but if the factory doesn't put the wiring & switches in for the option, you can't turn it on & it will remain dormant in the programming and not hurt anything (normally). This is where it gets weird. Like the other options, Vehicle Theft Security System is built into all PCM's & BCM's. If the vehicle is not equipped with the factory security system, it should remain dormant as the customer has no way to activate it (i.e. key fob or remote control). However, this era of DMX vehicle decides, for no earthly reason what so ever, that today it should turn on the usually \"dormant\" factory security system that the customer did not purchase with the vehicle. When this happens, the customer or technicians have no way to turn it off because the vehicle is not equipped with the rest of the system's components like the transmitters (key fobs), receiver, door lock disarming switches, etc. In effect, the Theft Deterrent System ( that this vehicle is not equipped with) has turned itself on. ONCE it has been enabled EVEN THE DEALER CAN NOT TURN IT OFF! The fix unfortunately, is to replace BOTH the PCM & the BCM. the system is activated in both modules. By just replacing the PCM, the BCM will tell all subsequent PCM's that the vehicle has VTSS and automatically enable the system in the new PCM. The BCM & PCM MUST be replaced at the SAME TIME to fix this condition. Two \"virgin\" computers from Chrysler will cost you a mint. You can use Junk Yard computers however, THEY MUST come from a vehicle that was not equipped with VTSS and MUST be installed at the same time! Sorry to be so long winded but I wanted to give you some background on this system so you don't bankrupt yourself buying PCM after PCM only to have the Body Control Module corrupt all of your replacement PCM's.

If that is the problem you should be able to take the key and lock and unlock all the doors and trunk and this will disarm the system\n\nDoes it have an antitheft system? If it does this how it acts. Unlock passenger door with key should enable.Hope this helps Dave\n\nIf the problem started just after they replaced the battery and alternator, you may have wiring problems. ck: tps voltage, ref, and ground circuit at tps.\n\nif the key lock in door trick does not work , order ecm from dealer or remanufacturer that does not have antitheft built into it, have had a couple where that was the only fix. should say only cost efective fix for that old of a unit\n\nsounds like you may have some kind of an anti thefet systemthat is cutting out the fuel after a few seconds as it does not have a signal to let the vehicle run and computer thinking it is being stolen and cutting fuel inj pulse.\n\nSounds like you are in theft mode. Even if car does not have security system, computer has it built in, & sometimes they just slip into theft mode. Had a 90 model Chrysler do this few months ago . Exactly same symptoms as this car. Lucky for me used comp. fixed this one . Chrysler had bulletin adressing this I think, but I dont have access to it. GOOD LUCK & GOD BLESS\n\nYou need to check for alarm system being turned on, even if vehicle is not equipped this can happen. Check to see if fuel is enabled.

If its a snap on it will be under system tests. Check the anti-theft status. All models have this test available even if they don't have anti theft. If it says ACTIVE or equivalent when starting the vehicle and the vehicle does NOT have anti theft, the computer must be replaced. This cannot be flashed back once it thinks it has anti-theft. If the vehicle DOES have antitheft just diagnose normally. I've change a couple computers due to this problem. Good hunting!\n\nThis is an anti theft problem. Since it does nothing with OE computer, its safe to say its bad. I would assume the new one is not compatible, but I would first check theft system.-------------- Original message -------------- >\n\nHoward, the problem you are having is the powertrain control module is looking for SAM (Security Alarm Module) and doesn't see it. The car probably doesn't have theft alarm, if it did there would be an amber flashing light below the headlamp switch. All pcm's have the program in them for theft alarm but they are suppose to only look for SAM if there is an alarm on the car. There are a lot of Pcm's that don't have the alarm looking for SAM. When this happens the pcm does not see SAM on the buss and shuts down the injectors. You'll need a new pcm or even a reman unit. After the pcm is replaced and the car has theft alarm you. Get in touch with me if you need a legal divorce from SAM. can get a legal divorce and the pcm will never look for sam, again. If you don't have theft alarm you are now fixed. Get in touch with me if you need to divorce the Sam from the system.\n\nhoward if this car does not have a alarm system, try a map sensor, hope this helps.\n\n08-02-95 tsb swaping pcms/bcms can learn vtss (vehicle theft security) on either modual have to replace both moduals to get it to start if change just one of moduals will learn theft from other modual. have to replace both. could have been your \"used pcm\" had theft now your bcm/pcm both have theft. duane\n\nSimilar case recently, same year and model, and engine combo, although mine would run until warm and under load, or higher RPM's, it would cut out. May be worth it to check out the crank sensor, even though the scanner is showing it's there, and even if you get a waveform from it. It may not be a good enough signal. Of course, I wouldn't even bother until checking the security system stuff that many have already mentioned!\n\nIf it does not have an anti theft,I would look for corroded ground wire on intake manifold towards the firewll,they are hard to see, but I had one do the same thing. Bill\n\nYour used computer is from a vehicle with an alarm system. The alarm system allows the vehicle to start, but zeroes the injector pulse when the key is returned to the \"on\" position from \"crank\". This kills the injectors.Did the original vehicle have an alarm (security) system?? If not, you have one now, and no way to turn it off!Jim\n\nHoward, Does this vehicle have the security system from the factory in it? You probably cannot tell by looking. Try this. Insert the key in the drivers door. Now lock the door and then unlock the door. Try and see if it will run now. If it does you are done.If not try the lock and unlock at the passangers door. See if it starts now. The factory security system is the type that requires a signal to run. When the signal does not show at the computer it will start and die out. The switch to turn it on and off are in the doors. Also, if the batter goes blat or is disconnected it comes back on in the on position. Locking and unlocking the doors clears this and will let it run. By the way. A used computer from the salvage yard may be just fine but not work in the car due to the fact that the previous vehicles system may not have had or did have a security system. Hope this helps. Bob Amos--- Howard from Pennsylvania> Yahoo! Mail - PC Magazine Editors' Choice 2005 http://mail.yahoo.com\n\nYou could look on the positive battery cable. The cable should have a pig tail that looks like a radio antenna connection. If it has this type of connection check for voltage drop after the connection. Also check the fusable links that are close to battery for damage or deterioration. Good Luck,\n\ntry taking the key out of ignition putting it in the drivers door lock cylinder lock and then unlock drivers door get into car make sure hood & trunk are closed and try to start car. some of these cars come with factory installed alarm systems and if battery was disconnected it may have to be reset try this out if not try to look in owners manual about battery disconnect and it may tell you how to restart system\n\nunlock doors with key then try to start it security is on\n\nHi Howard- Here's the deal. This car is activating the VTSS (Vehicle Theft Security System). Now you're probably saying to your self \"this vehicle is not equipped with VTSS.\" and you are correct! These Chrysler vehicles use 3 computers linked together by a 2 wire bus system so they can talk to each other and share common information that one computer might need from the other. It has PCM (engine), TCM (transmission) & BCM (body control) modules. In an effort to reduce the number of individually unique control modules that they would have to produce for different option packages, Chrysler decided to load ALL of the available options into their computers. This means that every vehicle has the capability of having cruise control, VTSS, A/C, Delay Wipers, etc... These option remain \"dormant\" if the vehicle doesn't have the controls to turn it on. Example: Cruise control is built into the computer(s) but if the factory doesn't put the wiring & switches in for the option, you can't turn it on & it will remain dormant in the programming and not hurt anything (normally). This is where it gets weird. Like the other options, Vehicle Theft Security System is built into all PCM's & BCM's. If the vehicle is not equipped with the factory security system, it should remain dormant as the customer has no way to activate it (i.e. key fob or remote control). However, this era of DMX vehicle decides, for no earthly reason what so ever, that today it should turn on the usually \"dormant\" factory security system that the customer did not purchase with the vehicle. When this happens, the customer or technicians have no way to turn it off because the vehicle is not equipped with the rest of the system's components like the transmitters (key fobs), receiver, door lock disarming switches, etc. In effect, the Theft Deterrent System ( that this vehicle is not equipped with) has turned itself on. ONCE it has been enabled EVEN THE DEALER CAN NOT TURN IT OFF! The fix unfortunately, is to replace BOTH the PCM & the BCM. the system is activated in both modules. By just replacing the PCM, the BCM will tell all subsequent PCM's that the vehicle has VTSS and automatically enable the system in the new PCM. The BCM & PCM MUST be replaced at the SAME TIME to fix this condition. Two \"virgin\" computers from Chrysler will cost you a mint. You can use Junk Yard computers however, THEY MUST come from a vehicle that was not equipped with VTSS and MUST be installed at the same time! Sorry to be so long winded but I wanted to give you some background on this system so you don't bankrupt yourself buying PCM after PCM only to have the Body Control Module corrupt all of your replacement PCM's. I hope this helps!Tim Bresnahan _Skippy6800@aol.com_ (mailto:Skippy6800@aol.com)",

The ABS Pump/Module, ECU, or Any wheels/suspension were not damaged, or removed. I have seen these codes come up with faulty ABS Modules/Pumps, so i decided to try a different ABS pump (Used one). The same codes come up. Although checked to make sure all the under dash wiring were connected, is their any components under the dash that may cause this issue? Any help is greatly appreciated.Regards, Val C. R.A.C",
         "Val,If you changed the steering angle sensor or modulator, you need to perform VSA neutralization procedure. It should be in the book. If you can't find it e-mail me and I'll dig it up and send it.\n\nPlease check the condition of battery, it may have been low at one time, then reset the code, and see if it appears again on good battery.\n\nDTC 86-1x (‘‘x'' can be 0 thru 9 or A thru F): Faulty OPDS Seat-Back SensorDTC 86-2x (‘‘x'' can be 0 thru 9 or A thru F): Faulty OPDS Seat Support SensorNOTE: Before doing this troubleshooting procedure, review SRS Precautions and Procedures and General Troubleshooting Information.Clear the DTC with the HDS.Turn the ignition switch to ON (II), or press the engine start/stop button to select the ON mode, then wait for 10 seconds.Check for DTCs with the HDS.Is DTC 86-1x or 86-2x indicated?YES — Go to step 4.NO — Intermittent failure, the system is OK at this time. Go to Troubleshooting Intermittent Failures. If another DTC is indicated, troubleshoot the DTC.■Turn the ignition switch to LOCK (0), or press the engine start/stop button to select the OFF mode.Check the connection between front passenger's seat wire harness 18P connector (A) and the OPDS sensor connectors (B), and ODS unit.Are the connections OK?YES — Go to step 6.NO — Repair the poor connections, then clear the DTC. If DTC 86-1x or 86-2x is still present, go to step 6.Replace the seat-back cover/pad with equipped OPDS sensor, then clear the DTC.Do the ODS unit initialization.Turn the ignition switch to LOCK (0), press the engine start/stop button to select the OFF mode, then wait for 10 seconds.Turn the ignition switch to ON (II), or press the engine start/stop button to select the ON mode, then wait for 10 seconds.Check for DTCs with the HDS.Is DTC 86-1x or 86-2x indicated?YES — Replace the ODS unit, then clear the DTC. If the DTC is still present, replace the SRS unit.■NO — The system is OK.■\n\nNOTE:After ODS unit is replaced, do this procedure to initialize the ODS unit.ODS unit initialization will initialize both OPDS sensor and seat weight sensor.OPDS Sensor Initialization After a seat-back cover/pad, and/or ODS unit is replaced, do this procedure to initialize the OPDS sensor with the HDS.NOTE:A new (uninitialized) ODS unit installed with a faulty OPDS sensor can cause DTC 85-71 and DTC 85-78.Before initializing the ODS unit, make sure the battery is fully charged.Clear the DTC with the HDS.Make sure the front passenger's seat is dry. Set the seat-back in a normal position, and make sure there is nothing on the seat.Make sure the ignition switch is in LOCK (0), or press the engine start/stop button to select the OFF mode.Connect the HDS to the data link connector (DLC) (A).Turn the ignition switch to ON (II), or press the engine start/stop button to select the ON mode.Make sure the HDS communicates with the vehicle and the SRS unit. If it does not communicate, troubleshoot the DLC circuit.From the HDS Main Menu, select SRS, then INITIALIZATION. In the INITIALIZATION Menu, select ODS Initialization. Follow the prompts until the OPDS sensor initialization has been completed.Turn the ignition switch to LOCK (0), or press the engine start/stop button to select the OFF mode.Disconnect the HDS from the DLC.NOTE: If the ODS unit fails to initialize after several attempts, replace the seat-back cover/pad with equipped OPDS sensor and retry. If the ODS unit continues to fail to initialize, replace the ODS unit.Front Passenger's Weight Sensor Initialization When you replace the SRS unit, the front passenger's weight sensor, the front passenger's seat assembly, or the ODS unit, initialize the front passenger's weight sensor with the HDS.While doing the initialization of the ODS unit, observe these precautions:Before initializing the front passenger's weight sensor, make sure the battery is fully charged.Make sure all components of the front passenger's seat are correctly installed.Make sure nothing is the front passenger's seat.Make sure there is nothing in the front passenger's seat-back pocket.Keep the windows and the moonroof closed.Do all initialization procedures, except test-driving, in the service bay.Make sure the vehicle is on level ground.Keep the A/C and the heater off.Do not touch the front passenger's seat during initialization, until you are prompted to or when you have completed the initialization.Do not expose the front passenger's seat to sudden temperature changes.Position the front passenger's all the way rearward, and adjust the seat-back to the forward most position. Do not move the seat from this position until the initialization is completed.Make sure the ignition switch is in LOCK (0), or press the engine start/stop button to select the OFF mode.Connect the HDS to the data link connector (DLC) (A).Turn the ignition switch to ON (II), or press the engine start/stop button to select the ON mode.Make sure the HDS communicates with the vehicle and the SRS unit. If it does not communicate, troubleshoot the DLC circuit.Drive the vehicle, and accelerate to 20 mph (36 km/h), then stop on level ground.From the HDS Main Menu, select SRS, then INITIALIZATION. In the INITIALIZATION Menu, select SWS Initialization. Follow the prompts until the front passenger's weight sensor initialization has been completed.Turn the ignition switch to LOCK (0), or press the engine start/stop button to select the OFF mode.Disconnect the HDS from the DLC.",
         "{\"score\": 2, \"reasoning\": \"The output provided does not directly address the issue of the ABS/VSA indicator light being on or the DTC code '86-1 CAN RELATION FAILURE' in the context of the 2009 Acura TL. Instead, it discusses procedures related to the SRS system, OPDS sensor, and front passenger's weight sensor initialization, which are not directly relevant to the problem described in the input. The initial response about performing the VSA neutralization procedure and checking the battery condition is somewhat relevant but lacks specificity and detail in relation to the DTC code provided. Overall, the output does not provide a clear solution or troubleshooting steps for the ABS/VSA issue described.\"}"

Since they REFUSE to sell parts to the aftermarket, we are forced to find alternative means to keep a good customer happy. (Besides, his son is the owner/founder of Nortech Powerboats.....) We have done some preliminary research, and it appears that we can retrofit this Jeep to a vacuum booster and do away with the abs system entirely.

Now lock the door and then unlock the door. Try and see if it will run now. If it does you are done.If not try the lock and unlock at the passangers door. See if it starts now. The factory security system is the type that requires a signal to run. When the signal does not show at the computer it will start and die out. The switch to turn it on and off are in the doors. Also, if the batter goes blat or is disconnected it comes back on in the on position. Locking and unlocking the doors clears this and will let it run. By the way. A used computer from the salvage yard may be just fine but not work in the car due to the fact that the previous vehicles system may not have had or did have a security system. Hope this helps.

       "Hi Howard- Here's the deal. This car is activating the VTSS (Vehicle Theft Security System). Now you're probably saying to your self \"this vehicle is not equipped with VTSS.\" and you are correct! These Chrysler vehicles use 3 computers linked together by a 2 wire bus system so they can talk to each other and share common information that one computer might need from the other. It has PCM (engine), TCM (transmission) & BCM (body control) modules. In an effort to reduce the number of individually unique control modules that they would have to produce for different option packages, Chrysler decided to load ALL of the available options into their computers. This means that every vehicle has the capability of having cruise control, VTSS, A/C, Delay Wipers, etc... These option remain \"dormant\" if the vehicle doesn't have the controls to turn it on. Example: Cruise control is built into the computer(s) but if the factory doesn't put the wiring & switches in for the option, you can't turn it on & it will remain dormant in the programming and not hurt anything (normally). This is where it gets weird. Like the other options, Vehicle Theft Security System is built into all PCM's & BCM's. If the vehicle is not equipped with the factory security system, it should remain dormant as the customer has no way to activate it (i.e. key fob or remote control). However, this era of DMX vehicle decides, for no earthly reason what so ever, that today it should turn on the usually \"dormant\" factory security system that the customer did not purchase with the vehicle. When this happens, the customer or technicians have no way to turn it off because the vehicle is not equipped with the rest of the system's components like the transmitters (key fobs), receiver, door lock disarming switches, etc. In effect, the Theft Deterrent System ( that this vehicle is not equipped with) has turned itself on. ONCE it has been enabled EVEN THE DEALER CAN NOT TURN IT OFF! The fix unfortunately, is to replace BOTH the PCM & the BCM. the system is activated in both modules. By just replacing the PCM, the BCM will tell all subsequent PCM's that the vehicle has VTSS and automatically enable the system in the new PCM. The BCM & PCM MUST be replaced at the SAME TIME to fix this condition. Two \"virgin\" computers from Chrysler will cost you a mint. You can use Junk Yard computers however, THEY MUST come from a vehicle that was not equipped with VTSS and MUST be installed at the same time! Sorry to be so long winded but I wanted to give you some background on this system so you don't bankrupt yourself buying PCM after PCM only to have the Body Control Module corrupt all of your replacement PCM's. I hope this helps!Tim Bresnahan _Skippy6800@aol.com_ (mailto:Skippy6800@aol.com)</td><td>2</td><td>The output provided does not directly address the user's question and symptoms described.

It involved using 5W-30 oil instead of 10W-30. So I tried it. New oil and filter. It helped marginally. Now I only have almost 90lbs cold at 3000rpm.

If your scan tool picks up and records data take it on a test drive and have an assistant record data from each wheel at a steady speed. That should indicate the wheel at fault. Without a scan tool you can put it off the ground and hook your scope up to each wheel in turn and watch the pattern.

If it says ACTIVE or equivalent when starting the vehicle and the vehicle does NOT have anti theft, the computer must be replaced. This cannot be flashed back once it thinks it has anti-theft.

Since it does nothing with OE computer, its safe to say its bad. I would assume the new one is not compatible, but I would first check theft system.-------------- Original message -------------- >\n\nHoward, the problem you are having is the powertrain control module is looking for SAM (Security Alarm Module) and doesn't see it. The car probably doesn't have theft alarm, if it did there would be an amber flashing light below the headlamp switch. All pcm's have the program in them for theft alarm but they are suppose to only look for SAM if there is an alarm on the car. There are a lot of Pcm's that don't have the alarm looking for SAM. When this happens the pcm does not see SAM on the buss and shuts down the injectors. You'll need a new pcm or even a reman unit. After the pcm is replaced and the car has theft alarm you. Get in touch with me if you need a legal divorce from SAM. can get a legal divorce and the pcm will never look for sam, again. If you don't have theft alarm you are now fixed. Get in touch with me if you need to divorce the Sam from the system.\n\nhoward if this car does not have a alarm system, try a map sensor, hope this helps.\n\n08-02-95 tsb swaping pcms/bcms can learn vtss (vehicle theft security) on either modual have to replace both moduals to get it to start if change just one of moduals will learn theft from other modual. have to replace both. could have been your \"used pcm\" had theft now your bcm/pcm both have theft. duane\n\nSimilar case recently, same year and model, and engine combo, although mine would run until warm and under load, or higher RPM's, it would cut out. May be worth it to check out the crank sensor, even though the scanner is showing it's there, and even if you get a waveform from it. It may not be a good enough signal. Of course, I wouldn't even bother until checking the security system stuff that many have already mentioned!\n\nIf it does not have an anti theft,I would look for corroded ground wire on intake manifold towards the firewll,they are hard to see, but I had one do the same thing. Bill\n\nYour used computer is from a vehicle with an alarm system. The alarm system allows the vehicle to start, but zeroes the injector pulse when the key is returned to the \"on\" position from \"crank\". This kills the injectors.Did the original vehicle have an alarm (security) system?? If not, you have one now, and no way to turn it off!Jim\n\nHoward, Does this vehicle have the security system from the factory in it? You probably cannot tell by looking. Try this. Insert the key in the drivers door. Now lock the door and then unlock the door. Try and see if it will run now. If it does you are done.If not try the lock and unlock at the passangers door. See if it starts now. The factory security system is the type that requires a signal to run. When the signal does not show at the computer it will start and die out. The switch to turn it on and off are in the doors. Also, if the batter goes blat or is disconnected it comes back on in the on position. Locking and unlocking the doors clears this and will let it run. By the way. A used computer from the salvage yard may be just fine but not work in the car due to the fact that the previous vehicles system may not have had or did have a security system. Hope this helps. Bob Amos--- Howard from Pennsylvania> Yahoo! Mail - PC Magazine Editors' Choice 2005 http://mail.yahoo.com\n\nYou could look on the positive battery cable. The cable should have a pig tail that looks like a radio antenna connection. If it has this type of connection check for voltage drop after the connection. Also check the fusable links that are close to battery for damage or deterioration. Good Luck,\n\ntry taking the key out of ignition putting it in the drivers door lock cylinder lock and then unlock drivers door get into car make sure hood & trunk are closed and try to start car. some of these cars come with factory installed alarm systems and if battery was disconnected it may have to be reset try this out if not try to look in owners manual about battery disconnect and it may tell you how to restart system\n\nunlock doors with key then try to start it security is on\n\nHi Howard- Here's the deal. This car is activating the VTSS (Vehicle Theft Security System). Now you're probably saying to your self \"this vehicle is not equipped with VTSS.\" and you are correct! These Chrysler vehicles use 3 computers linked together by a 2 wire bus system so they can talk to each other and share common information that one computer might need from the other. It has PCM (engine), TCM (transmission) & BCM (body control) modules. In an effort to reduce the number of individually unique control modules that they would have to produce for different option packages, Chrysler decided to load ALL of the available options into their computers. This means that every vehicle has the capability of having cruise control, VTSS, A/C, Delay Wipers, etc... These option remain \"dormant\" if the vehicle doesn't have the controls to turn it on. Example: Cruise control is built into the computer(s) but if the factory doesn't put the wiring & switches in for the option, you can't turn it on & it will remain dormant in the programming and not hurt anything (normally). This is where it gets weird. Like the other options, Vehicle Theft Security System is built into all PCM's & BCM's. If the vehicle is not equipped with the factory security system, it should remain dormant as the customer has no way to activate it (i.e. key fob or remote control). However, this era of DMX vehicle decides, for no earthly reason what so ever, that today it should turn on the usually \"dormant\" factory security system that the customer did not purchase with the vehicle. When this happens, the customer or technicians have no way to turn it off because the vehicle is not equipped with the rest of the system's components like the transmitters (key fobs), receiver, door lock disarming switches, etc. In effect, the Theft Deterrent System ( that this vehicle is not equipped with) has turned itself on. ONCE it has been enabled EVEN THE DEALER CAN NOT TURN IT OFF! The fix unfortunately, is to replace BOTH the PCM & the BCM. the system is activated in both modules. By just replacing the PCM, the BCM will tell all subsequent PCM's that the vehicle has VTSS and automatically enable the system in the new PCM. The BCM & PCM MUST be replaced at the SAME TIME to fix this condition. Two \"virgin\" computers from Chrysler will cost you a mint. You can use Junk Yard computers however, THEY MUST come from a vehicle that was not equipped with VTSS and MUST be installed at the same time! Sorry to be so long winded but I wanted to give you some background on this system so you don't bankrupt yourself buying PCM after PCM only to have the Body Control Module corrupt all of your replacement PCM's. I hope this helps!Tim Bresnahan _Skippy6800@aol.com_ (mailto:Skippy6800@aol.com)",

         "We have a 2009 Acura TL which was involved in a accident to the Left side. The vehicle was repaired at out shop. The ABS/VSA indicator light is on. We scanned the vehicle, the DTC CODE \"86-1 CAN RELATION FAILURE\" comes up. We had to remove the Dash Panel in order to complete the repairs. The ABS Pump/Module, ECU, or Any wheels/suspension were not damaged, or removed. I have seen these codes come up with faulty ABS Modules/Pumps, so i decided to try a different ABS pump (Used one). The same codes come up. Although checked to make sure all the under dash wiring were connected, is their any components under the dash that may cause this issue? Any help is greatly appreciated.Regards, Val C. R.A.C",
         "Val,If you changed the steering angle sensor or modulator, you need to perform VSA neutralization procedure. It should be in the book. If you can't find it e-mail me and I'll dig it up and send it.\n\nPlease check the condition of battery, it may have been low at one time, then reset the code, and see if it appears again on good battery.\n\nDTC 86-1x (‘‘x'' can be 0 thru 9 or A thru F): Faulty OPDS Seat-Back SensorDTC 86-2x (‘‘x'' can be 0 thru 9 or A thru F): Faulty OPDS Seat Support SensorNOTE: Before doing this troubleshooting procedure, review SRS Precautions and Procedures and General Troubleshooting Information.Clear the DTC with the HDS.Turn the ignition switch to ON (II), or press the engine start/stop button to select the ON mode, then wait for 10 seconds.Check for DTCs with the HDS.Is DTC 86-1x or 86-2x indicated?YES — Go to step 4.NO — Intermittent failure, the system is OK at this time. Go to Troubleshooting Intermittent Failures. If another DTC is indicated, troubleshoot the DTC.■Turn the ignition switch to LOCK (0), or press the engine start/stop button to select the OFF mode.Check the connection between front passenger's seat wire harness 18P connector (A) and the OPDS sensor connectors (B), and ODS unit.Are the connections OK?YES — Go to step 6.NO — Repair the poor connections, then clear the DTC. If DTC 86-1x or 86-2x is still present, go to step 6.Replace the seat-back cover/pad with equipped OPDS sensor, then clear the DTC.Do the ODS unit initialization.Turn the ignition switch to LOCK (0), press the engine start/stop button to select the OFF mode, then wait for 10 seconds.Turn the ignition switch to ON (II), or press the engine start/stop button to select the ON mode, then wait for 10 seconds.Check for DTCs with the HDS.Is DTC 86-1x or 86-2x indicated?YES — Replace the ODS unit, then clear the DTC. If the DTC is still present, replace the SRS unit.■NO — The system is OK.■\n\nNOTE:After ODS unit is replaced, do this procedure to initialize the ODS unit.ODS unit initialization will initialize both OPDS sensor and seat weight sensor.OPDS Sensor Initialization After a seat-back cover/pad, and/or ODS unit is replaced, do this procedure to initialize the OPDS sensor with the HDS.NOTE:A new (uninitialized) ODS unit installed with a faulty OPDS sensor can cause DTC 85-71 and DTC 85-78.Before initializing the ODS unit, make sure the battery is fully charged.Clear the DTC with the HDS.Make sure the front passenger's seat is dry. Set the seat-back in a normal position, and make sure there is nothing on the seat.Make sure the ignition switch is in LOCK (0), or press the engine start/stop button to select the OFF mode.Connect the HDS to the data link connector (DLC) (A).Turn the ignition switch to ON (II), or press the engine start/stop button to select the ON mode.Make sure the HDS communicates with the vehicle and the SRS unit. If it does not communicate, troubleshoot the DLC circuit.From the HDS Main Menu, select SRS, then INITIALIZATION. In the INITIALIZATION Menu, select ODS Initialization. Follow the prompts until the OPDS sensor initialization has been completed.Turn the ignition switch to LOCK (0), or press the engine start/stop button to select the OFF mode.Disconnect the HDS from the DLC.NOTE: If the ODS unit fails to initialize after several attempts, replace the seat-back cover/pad with equipped OPDS sensor and retry. If the ODS unit continues to fail to initialize, replace the ODS unit.Front Passenger's Weight Sensor Initialization When you replace the SRS unit, the front passenger's weight sensor, the front passenger's seat assembly, or the ODS unit, initialize the front passenger's weight sensor with the HDS.While doing the initialization of the ODS unit, observe these precautions:Before initializing the front passenger's weight sensor, make sure the battery is fully charged.Make sure all components of the front passenger's seat are correctly installed.Make sure nothing is the front passenger's seat.Make sure there is nothing in the front passenger's seat-back pocket.Keep the windows and the moonroof closed.Do all initialization procedures, except test-driving, in the service bay.Make sure the vehicle is on level ground.Keep the A/C and the heater off.Do not touch the front passenger's seat during initialization, until you are prompted to or when you have completed the initialization.Do not expose the front passenger's seat to sudden temperature changes.Position the front passenger's all the way rearward, and adjust the seat-back to the forward most position. Do not move the seat from this position until the initialization is completed.Make sure the ignition switch is in LOCK (0), or press the engine start/stop button to select the OFF mode.Connect the HDS to the data link connector (DLC) (A).Turn the ignition switch to ON (II), or press the engine start/stop button to select the ON mode.Make sure the HDS communicates with the vehicle and the SRS unit. If it does not communicate, troubleshoot the DLC circuit.Drive the vehicle, and accelerate to 20 mph (36 km/h), then stop on level ground.From the HDS Main Menu, select SRS, then INITIALIZATION. In the INITIALIZATION Menu, select SWS Initialization.

I need some help with this BMW 2011 335i ,, I replaced the oil filter housing gasket with new filter and new oil,now engine start for 2 seconds then die,,I replaced the sensor with a used one but good sensor and it I didn't work I replaced the the DME and is doing the same thing.. I'm going crazy with this car .. Don't know what else to do,, any help will be well appreciated,, I'm getting the high oil pressure before engine starting code 3429",
         "If the vehicle ran before u worked on it I would check the wiring to the oil switch make sure I haven’t crossed any plugs stop the shot gun approach put the original parts back on it and start with a wiring diagram and some good common sense\n\nMaybe the car is right - oil pressure is too high. I would check my work, look for the obstruction.\n\nPossible the motor seized due to lack of oil pressure. Damage was done due to poor maintenance early in life. Unfortunately, this has happened to others doing the very same repair. This repair was the nail in the coffin.\n\nThere's only one logical explanation to this. Oil filter housing contains oil pressure switch. The first place oil ends up after being picked thru oil pick up pipe from oil pan is filter, before is distributed to entire engine oil galleries. In your scenario, oil gets to the filter and is not leaving it, causing pressure to build up, hence your fault code and starting issue. Check your filter first. Also, if I remember correctly, housing contains pressure relief valve, make sure all good around there. As mentioned earlier, look for obstructions!\n\nWrong oil filter is not an uncommon problem. Just because it seems to fit does not mean it is right. Look at it closely.\n\nIt all started by changing the oil filter . try ro start it with the old filter or without it . That will clear one side of the problem . First check the oil pressure connection for good contact . Good luck\n\nEnsure that the oil-temp and oil-press sensor connectors are not switched.\n\nthis is a f car ? if so dme is married to the car ,you cant swap dme.install the original dme and start from basics whas is missing .\n\nSo you must have pulled the intake manifold to get the housing out. I would retrace my steps. There is something possibly plugged in wrong or pinched even. Remove and re inspect slowly. I know it’s stressful. Take a break and start fresh.\n\nA code description will be a big help. I think you may have contaminated vanos solenoids with brake clean.

It would have been disconnected to pull back the intake.\n\nPlease data to verify data input and output. check the basic.\n\nthat dose not make sense if you just replace the oil filter gasket and it was working right before it may be that the battery wend dead and the DME lost the adaptation of the throtel body if you have Bmw ISTA you need to relearn. the adaptation for the throttle body and rest all adaptions other then that this car have more problems them just oil leeks .\n\nKudos to you man - considering there was no code for fuel system",
